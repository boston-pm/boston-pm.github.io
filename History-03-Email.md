# The MIT Era 2005-08-09 - 2020-03-09

For 15 years, MIT IT and Facilities provided user group meeting space on campus for the convenience of MIT staff and other community members who wished to attend.

The facilities were very nice MBA case rooms in the Business & Humanities building E51, with built-in A/V.


*MIT Era spans the file break between [Part i](History-02-Calendar.html) and and this Part ii, due to source of information. Part i was extracted from 2-3 generations of Wiki Calendar Archives. 
This Part ii is extracted from Email archives, which accounts for the change in format.*

## January 10th - Brian D. Foy (bdf), "6 More Things about 6"

Tues, Jan 10th, 2017, 7:30 Room E51-376

**learningperl6.png**

"6 More Things about 6" will cover a combination of features, ideas,
and concepts that I find interesting about the new language. I'll also
answer question about the upcoming "Learning Perl 6" book, the Kickstarter
campaign for it, and other things you may want to ask.

About the speaker
***brian d foy*** is a long time member of the Perl community, a prolific Perl trainer, and writer. 
In addition to authoring the upcoming *Learning Perl 6,*† he's the the
author of *Mastering Perl*, and co-author of *Programming Perl*,

## February postponed to March postponed to April

## April 11th - Ricky Morse, Digital pack-ratting for Tumblr (Perl 5 and Perl 6)

*Twice postponed because Valentines had basically 0 RSVP and Pi(e) Day 3.14 had a Blizzard Watch*

I’m a bit of a digital pack-rat, so I will be showing a tool that I developed to help me hoard Tumblr meme posts. As a bonus, just for this talk I wrote something in Perl 6 that does a similar task for XKCD.

(So if you're looking for ways to capture unstructured (no API) data from the web with Perl, this talk is for you.) ​

[slides](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2017-04-tumblr/index.html)

**Ricky Morse** has been using Perl for various things since the late 90s.

(*Deferred from Feb 14th  Valentines Day to March 14th Pi(e) Day ... and also the latest 2nd Tuesday falls, so two months in a row, BLU.org 3rd Wednesday Linux/Unix meeting fell the day after Boston.PM, twice since not a leap year.*)

( ***3.14 is Pie Day.*** *We usually have Pizza which is Pie and a Pi joke in
itself, so I'll bring rectangular cookies that are trigonometric in a
different way. If someone brings a dessert Pie, that would be OK too. -- Bill *)

(*OK we now have a* ***BLIZZARD WATCH*** *posted by [NWS](https://weather.gov/box) . 
Odds of Perl meeting Tuesday drops fractionally every hour that stays in effect and more so if elevated to a Warning.
As if it wasn't obvious ...  Meeting tonight is canceled, speaker and topic postponed to April 11th. 
Pi Day will be observed online. - Bill* )

## May the Fourth, Cookout Social (in lieu of Tech meeting)

Celebrity guest **Randal L Schwartz**, at the home of Uri Guttman "Perl Hunter".

## June 13th New features, changes in Perl 5.26

Join us to see what's new in the latest Perl. Using slides prepared by
brian d foy for an AmsterdamX.pm presentation, we'll go over the
highlights of new features and changes in Perl 5.26, including the
potential disruptive change of removing the current directory (.) from
the @INC module search path. We'll supplement the slides with the
official Perl Delta (change log) document, and other online sources
where more depth is required. The talk will be an open discussion
format, with Bill Ricker leading us through the slides, but plenty of
opportunity for the audience to ask questions, or offer opinion, and
in some cases we'll try some live demos of the new features.


## July 11th, The Perl Conference 2017 Review : Lightning Talk Dim Sum ( from TPC / YAPC::NA)

Attendees will select Lightning Talks from [The Perl Conference 2017 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m). 
We can't play all 29 of them unless we 'gong' more than half
quickly after starting, but at 6 minutes each, we can get through a
dozen (unless we choose to discuss and experiment between).

Samples from among the 29 six-minute choices available -

* "Emulating Any API"
* "Perl 6 Str Considered Harmful"
* "Administering Slack Contests with Perl"
* "In Response to D. Conway's Test::Expr"
* "A Personalized Calendar in Perl"
* "Why Google's Dart should be your next programming language"
* "Hacking the Interviewing Process"


Bill will be our VJ, but the audience will lead.

## No August

## Sep 12th - The Perl Conference 2017 Review : Damian's keynote ( from TPC / YAPC::NA)

**Damian Conway, ["Three Little Words"](http://damian.conway.org/Seminars/ThreeLittleWords.html) (or "Why I Love Perl")** [(*recorded at The 2017 Perl Conference*)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m).

*Another MST3K YouTube TPC/YAPC screening and discussion*

Damian Conway, known for his rapid-paced, wide-ranging, tour-de-force
presentations, was the keynote presenter at The Perl Conference, 2017
(formerly known as YAPC::NA). In his keynote he tells "a tale of
madness, obsession, and coding extremity," describing what it took to
bring 3 keywords from Perl 6 to Perl 5. A community effort that took
three years and 2.8 million lines of code. This is a more extreme
example of what some developers are going through to bring Perl 6
functionality to Perl 5.

We will watch his recorded keynote and discuss among ourselves.

Even if you are new to Perl and don't follow all the technical
details, Damian's highly entertaining presentations are a must see.
(Plus, after the talk when we discuss it, we'll happily answer any
questions.)

About the speaker
**Damian Conway** is an author or co-author of numerous Perl books, and a
widely sought-after speaker and trainer.

## Tuesday, October 10th - GitHub Continuous Integration for Perl CPAN modules

Tonight (*As an emergency substitute talk*) we will be having
a mini-hackathon on the `Config::Std` CPAN module that Boston.pm
maintains. We'll be offering a live demonstration of setting up
continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI and Appveyor, two hosted
CI tools made freely available for open source projects on GitHub.
Join us as we stumble through the process and learn from our mistakes.

Perl has had `Test::Harness` for decades, with CPANTS providing
distributed Continuous Integration testing of Released CPAN module
distributions for a decade or more. Thank you CPANTS volunteers for
creating a distributed cloud for us :-).  Now GitHub is offering
similar capabilities to all the other FLOSS communities via free
integration with freemium cloud Continuous Integration tools Travis-CI
(for Linux) and Appveyor (for Windows). Since we have CPANTS for
release, we can use Travis-ci&Appveyor to test our DEV branch after
check-in. They'll even test Pull Requests before merge!  Any GitHub
FLOSS project can use these, but Perl CPAN projects can make use
easily since we already have a regression testing culture, we won't
need to write the tests, just enable them.

## Nov. 14th - Adam Russell (live!) - "Deep Learning in Perl"

**LIVE Speaker !**

*Remember, if you get Veterans' Day Monday off work, Tuesday will feel
like Monday.*

**"Deep Learning with AI::MXNet: Navigating implementation issues"**

ABSTRACT
This talk will cover lessons learned from a recent experience in
getting a deep learning projected started, with little prior
experience in AI. All code will use the Perl MXNet API and guide the
audience through developing a simple model, which is then built on to
perform more complex tasks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for a long time captured the popular
imagination. Results from academia and industry have finally started
to deliver on some of the long hoped for results: self driving cars,
automated medical diagnoses, and written and verbal language
processing. These areas are showing advances that were once simply
products of fiction writers. The current wave of AI enthusiasm may be
attributed to what is called Deep Learning which is a convenient label
for relatively new techniques using neural networks. The possibility
for increased automation across virtually every industry has resulted
in the spinning up of many new startup companies, as well as new
projects within existing enterprises, resulting in the need to develop
the skills necessary to pursue this new area.

While not the language of production, Perl is used to develop
algorithms and demonstrate concepts before they receive fuller
treatment. Deep Learning practitioners often begin their deep learning
work, correctly, with a review of the literature and research into the
fundamentals. Projects then often start confidently with high hopes,
built on that conceptual understanding, only to quickly get bogged
down in unforeseen, but critically important, issues of
implementation.


**Adam Russell** is a software engineer with OptumLabs' Center for Applied
Data Science (CADS). CADS is tasked with developing prototype
applications which implement recent advances in algorithms and
technology to address issues of importance to Optum business
interests. Most recent projects have been focused on Deep Learning.
Adam has a PhD in Computer Science from the University of
Massachusetts Lowell, his academic interests involve Computational
Geometry and Data Visualization and these explorations, much like the
work described in this talk, are all Perl driven. He also teaches, on
an adjunct basis, at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.

## December - Canceled

# 2018

## Jan 9th - ad hoc social in MIT hallway 

*room reservation failed due to IAP, so we had a social in the hallway.*

## Feb 13th 2nd Tuesday -- Commercial Game Design with Modern Perl -- Ovid builds a MMORPG in Perl

*topic originally scheduled for January*

**Amsterdam Perl Conference 2017 video screening**

Noted Perl personality **Ovid (Curtis Poe)** has built a Space-exploration
on-line role-playing-game called "Tau Station" in Perl. It's even a
business. In this talk, he describes the games industry and how Modern
Perl makes building his game fun.

Original Abstract -

"With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser.
However, in object oriented design, what does the "single
responsibility principle" mean when your combat armor serves as armor,
a weapon, and medkit?

"And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated
requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit,
or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do
you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?

"And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe
drives almost everything?

"This talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for Tau
Station to easily model complex behaviors."

We'll have our usual community discussion after (or by hitting pause
as needed) in lieu of speaker Q&A.

## March - Winter Storm Watch no meeting

## April 10th (2nd Tuesday) - Federico Lucifredi / Hardware Hacking 101: time and randomness

**GPS! Randomness with Radiation!**

Abstract:
Using the lowest amount of custom hardware and pouring Perl over
everything as the glue binding it all, we create two minimalistic
devices delivering a perfectly tuned network time source
(synchronizing with a GPS satellite), and a naturally random entropy
source (leveraging a Geiger tube’s measurement of natural background
radiation).

## May 8th: shorts: Signatures and Precision


We'll watch (dissect?) two shorter conference videos, with our usual
MST3K commentary and rabbit-hole research. Topics are 3 dialects of
Function Signatures in  recent Perls and infinite precision
computation in Perl 6.

## June-August skipped

(1) August is canceled.

(2) We'll have a meeting in September; 2nd Tuesday is the 11th --
Where is TBD; maybe at MIT, maybe in Waltham.
If Waltham, it'll be near (T) bus and train as well as parking; and
I'll provide Car Pool out and or back for anyone that wants to.

(3) Our Wiki is down. Free provider has pulled the plug.
(In copious spare time, Tom and I are looking for right replacement.)
So temporarily boston.pm.org DNS points to a 404-ish page :-(


(4) Meantime, our Twitter, Facebook, G+ (*ominous music*), MeetUp, LinkedIn, and these

**September 11th: Ricky Morse - Perl 6 and Typesetting Formal Announcements**

or, ***Ringing halfsheets with Perl 6***


*Meetings resume !         September at the usual place*

After ringing a bell for 45 minutes to 3 hours, you kind of want
people to know you did it, and what you did it for. Ricky uses Perl 6
to replace a manual process for creating “half-sheets” to post in the
Old North ringing room, for tourists to see.

Ricky sensibly doesn't want to retype or copy-paste what's already
somewhere on-line, so he uses Perl 6 to pull the data from a database
as XML, and then typeset the half sheets. This is using **Perl6, [GROFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_%28software%29),**
and **C6PAN Modules** `Template::Mustache`, `XML::XPath`, and `HTTP::User
Agent`.

*Commemorative text of a peal rung*
![Commemorative text of a peal rung](./images/BellRingHalfSheet.png)

Ricky gave background on the Change Ringing style of bell ringing and also briefly listed various software paths he considered to transform XML to PDF for this print problem.

## October 9th - Mark Fowler, "Perl Advent Calendar Redux" ( ROAD TRIP )

For the October 9 gathering of Boston Perl Mongers we'll be hosted by [MaxMind](https://web.archive.org/web/20181018073906/https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)  in Waltham, instead of our usual MIT location. Our speaker will be Mark Fowler.

(Boston.PM is happy to accept this offer of hosting from MaxMind, and would welcome hosting offers from other organizations in Eastern MA. It gives those who live further West or otherwise are unable/unwilling to travel to the city a chance to attend.

"A resource for beginners and advanced Perl users alike, the Perl Advent calendar <http://www.perladvent.org/2017/> features humourous stories featuring Santa's Elves and the fun they have with Perl. This talk will talk about all the exciting things that occurred in (*last*) year's calendar. Somewhat akin to twenty four two minute lighting talks, it'll expose you to a range of topics."

About the Speaker

**Mark Fowler** is a manager with experience in running teams developing, maintaining, and improving innovative internet based technologies, currently working for MaxMind, an industry-leading provider of IP intelligence and online fraud detection tools.. He has a strong background in programming and development, speaking at conferences, and writing technical articles. Author/maintainer of 32 modules on CPAN.



( *Boston.pm's Jerrad Pierce was the first Perl Advent interregnum editor after Mark's inaugural stint. We've not been involved in the 2nd interregnum or the Restoration, so it will be very good to hear this!* )

##  Wednesday, October 17, 2018 - QualityBox: a MediaWiki hosting service - BLU - Greg Rundlett

***Hosted by [BLU](https://blu.org) Boston Linux Unix***

Moderator: **Greg Rundlett,** founder of eQuality Technology

**A guided tour of QualityBox, a MediaWiki hosting service**

Abstract:

Greg Rundlett, founder of eQuality Technology, has created a hosted
software service called QualityBox which is provides the wiki engine
(MediaWiki) that drives Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, QualityBox is
instantly usable by the end-user. And like Wikipedia, it includes a huge
number of configurations, extensions and customizations that make it
supremely useful. Greg will take us on a tour of QualityBox, and the
MediaWiki ecosystem to illustrate some of the features and capabilities
that are available right “out of the box”.

Featuring:
-	MediaWiki 1.31 LTS
-	Visual Editor
-	ElasticSearch (v5.6.10)
-	Excellent Mobile support
-	Modern and traditional layouts
-	New dashboards
-	Top to Bottom security upgrades
-	Free SSL certificates
-	Subdomain-based wiki farms
-	And LOTS more.

(*Narrator: The BLU and Boston.PM wikis were hosted as the demos on QualityBox. Alas the business model fizzled by the end of 2021. It was nice while it lasted. The experimental multi-tenancy MediaWiki was a cool idea.*)

## November - Charlotte PM founded (by JChrome); No Boston meeting

Ricky Morse will review the highlights of several of the Perl community Advent calendars of 2018.

Following up on Mark Fowler's Perl Advent 2017 review in October, Ricky takes on 3 of Advent calendars of 2018. 

[menu of select calendar pages](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2019-01-advent-roundup/index.html)

## February skipped



## March 12 - 25 years of Perl OO Evolution in one Hour (screening)

We stumbled on a video talk that provides a fast-forward review of how Perl's OO has evolved over the last 25 years.  We'll give that our MST3K commentary treatment.

## April 9 - Introducing Test2 (Chad Granum) - Ricky Morse (moderator)

[Test2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2) is a replacement for many of the Test modules, which comes 
with advanced comparison features, and a version of Ruby’s “SPEC” DSL.

Ricky screened **Chad Granum**’s [2018 Perl Conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2xIfBdcqb0) where 
he introduces the Test2 suite of modules. 

In addition, **Ricky** already had a bunch of tests written using Test2, 
which he showed from his iPad.


## May 14th - Jazzing up the output of Ack (a programmer's grep) with color - Bill Ricker

**Hue-Saturation-Luminance for Ack3 with Convert::Color::HSL and Term::ANSIColor**

Curious about how to handle different color spaces in Perl?

**Bill Ricker** will show how he improved RBG palette help for [**Ack3**](https://beyondgrep.com) using the HSL colorspace model and CPAN module that does HSL<->RGB transform.

Ack uses an  module [**`Term::ANSIColor`**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ANSIColor) that uses base-6 colors from 000 to 555 . 
`ack --help-rgb-colors` will display all possible colors.
The palette display was formerly laid-out as convenient for the code loop, not for the viewer's comprehension.

Reorganizing it according to a geometric color model makes it easier to see the various gradients between color coordinates. **Bill Ricker** used [**`Convert::Color::HSL`**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Convert::Color::HSL) to prototype a new palette-help, as seen in new [Ack3 code](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/blob/dev/dev/generate-rgb-codes.pl).


_The HSL model is very similar to the HSV model, with subtle distinction between "Luminance" and "Value" in the third, vertical coordinate:_

## June 11, E51-376 (Back to 3rd Floor) ¨Perl begat Perl¨ - Uri Guttman

They say only Perl can parse Perl, but Perl can also generate Perl. In "***Perl begat Perl***", a preview of a talk Uri will present at this year's Perl Conference, he will discuss how you can generate Perl inside Perl and then call eval on the code. Uri will explain why you might want to to use this technique, and illustrate it with good and bad examples.

**Uri Guttman** is a founding member of Boston Perl Mongers, a long time presence in the Perl community, and founder/owner of Stem Systems, a Perl consultancy, and known as "The Perl Hunter," a recruiter specializing in placing Perl talent.

[TPC Video of same talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMW1hCpP2Is) has abstract -

> Have you ever wondered why some CPAN modules actually generate Perl code to be eval'ed? Some of the reasons are simplicity but most often it is for getting faster running code. The key Perl feature used is eval on strings (the dangerous eval, not the safe eval of blocks). Newbies are always warned not to use string eval but this talk will show you why and how to use it for your benefit. Simple and common examples will be shown that anyone can use. Then more complex examples from existing CPAN modules (two of which are by the speaker) will be covered. They use Perl code generation for major speed gains (including 4x in one case).


NOTE:  Back to 3rd floor!

## October 8, MIT E51-376 - Conference Video Review - Sawyer X: future of Perl

Boston.pm will apply our MST3K interactive discussion style to one or more recent Conference Videos.

Couldn't make it to the last Perl Conference? In our next meeting (Tuesday, 10/8) we'll be viewing a keynote presentation from Sawyer X where he looks at what has transpired in the last 20 years, and then takes an honest and critical look at where the Perl 5 language stands today, and where it could go.

**how Perl 5.30 (2019) fits in arc of history and a possible future.**

but attendees can select a different one from shortlist or elsewhere for our interactive discussion (MST3K) treatment. 

## November - 2d Tuesday was day after Veteran's Day.
