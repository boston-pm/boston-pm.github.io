## January 10th - Brian D. Foy (bdf), "6 More Things about 6"

Tues, Jan 10th, 2017, 7:30 Room E51-376

**learningperl6.png**

"6 More Things about 6" will cover a combination of features, ideas,
and concepts that I find interesting about the new language. I'll also
answer question about the upcoming "Learning Perl 6" book, the Kickstarter
campaign for it, and other things you may want to ask.

About the speaker
***brian d foy*** is a long time member of the Perl community, a prolific Perl trainer, and writer. 
In addition to authoring the upcoming *Learning Perl 6,*† he's the the
author of *Mastering Perl*, and co-author of *Programming Perl*, 
*Learning Perl*, *Intermediate Perl*, and *Effective Perl Programming*.
He's a frequent speaker at Perl conferences. 
He founded the first Perl user group, the **New York Perl mongers,**
as well as the Perl advocacy nonprofit [**Perl Mongers**](https://www.pm.org).
A contributor to Perl documentation and maintainer of several modules on CPAN.

†(*Narrator: With the Raku language rename, ***Learning Raku*** is now the title of the book.
Also, FWIW, "Six things … about … " was an au courant cultural reference at the time. *)

## February postponed to March postponed to April

## April 11th - Ricky Morse, Digital pack-ratting for Tumblr (Perl 5 and Perl 6)

*Twice postponed because Valentines had basically 0 RSVP and Pi(e) Day 3.14 had a Blizzard Watch*

I’m a bit of a digital pack-rat, so I will be showing a tool that I developed to help me hoard Tumblr meme posts. As a bonus, just for this talk I wrote something in Perl 6 that does a similar task for XKCD.

(So if you're looking for ways to capture unstructured (no API) data from the web with Perl, this talk is for you.) ​

[slides](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2017-04-tumblr/index.html)

**Ricky Morse** has been using Perl for various things since the late 90s.

(*Deferred from Feb 14th  Valentines Day to March 14th Pi(e) Day ... and also the latest 2nd Tuesday falls, so two months in a row, BLU.org 3rd Wednesday Linux/Unix meeting fell the day after Boston.PM, twice since not a leap year.*)

( ***3.14 is Pie Day.*** *We usually have Pizza which is Pie and a Pi joke in
itself, so I'll bring rectangular cookies that are trigonometric in a
different way. If someone brings a dessert Pie, that would be OK too. -- Bill *)

(*OK we now have a* ***BLIZZARD WATCH*** *posted by [NWS](https://weather.gov/box) . 
Odds of Perl meeting Tuesday drops fractionally every hour that stays in effect and more so if elevated to a Warning.
As if it wasn't obvious ...  Meeting tonight is canceled, speaker and topic postponed to April 11th. 
Pi Day will be observed online. - Bill* )

## May the Fourth, Cookout Social (in lieu of Tech meeting)

Celebrity guest **Randal L Schwartz**, at the home of Uri Guttman "Perl Hunter".

## June 13th New features, changes in Perl 5.26

Join us to see what's new in the latest Perl. Using slides prepared by
brian d foy for an AmsterdamX.pm presentation, we'll go over the
highlights of new features and changes in Perl 5.26, including the
potential disruptive change of removing the current directory (.) from
the @INC module search path. We'll supplement the slides with the
official Perl Delta (change log) document, and other online sources
where more depth is required. The talk will be an open discussion
format, with Bill Ricker leading us through the slides, but plenty of
opportunity for the audience to ask questions, or offer opinion, and
in some cases we'll try some live demos of the new features.


## July 11th, The Perl Conference 2017 Review : Lightning Talk Dim Sum ( from TPC / YAPC::NA)

Attendees will select Lightning Talks from [The Perl Conference 2017 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m). 
We can't play all 29 of them unless we 'gong' more than half
quickly after starting, but at 6 minutes each, we can get through a
dozen (unless we choose to discuss and experiment between).

Samples from among the 29 six-minute choices available -

* "Emulating Any API"
* "Perl 6 Str Considered Harmful"
* "Administering Slack Contests with Perl"
* "In Response to D. Conway's Test::Expr"
* "A Personalized Calendar in Perl"
* "Why Google's Dart should be your next programming language"
* "Hacking the Interviewing Process"


Bill will be our VJ, but the audience will lead.

## No August

## Sep 12th - The Perl Conference 2017 Review : Damian's keynote ( from TPC / YAPC::NA)

**Damian Conway, ["Three Little Words"](http://damian.conway.org/Seminars/ThreeLittleWords.html) (or "Why I Love Perl")** [(*recorded at The 2017 Perl Conference*)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFxdSVDA4v9Af3iutQxLI14m).

*Another MST3K YouTube TPC/YAPC screening and discussion*

Damian Conway, known for his rapid-paced, wide-ranging, tour-de-force
presentations, was the keynote presenter at The Perl Conference, 2017
(formerly known as YAPC::NA). In his keynote he tells "a tale of
madness, obsession, and coding extremity," describing what it took to
bring 3 keywords from Perl 6 to Perl 5. A community effort that took
three years and 2.8 million lines of code. This is a more extreme
example of what some developers are going through to bring Perl 6
functionality to Perl 5.

We will watch his recorded keynote and discuss among ourselves.

Even if you are new to Perl and don't follow all the technical
details, Damian's highly entertaining presentations are a must see.
(Plus, after the talk when we discuss it, we'll happily answer any
questions.)

About the speaker
**Damian Conway** is an author or co-author of numerous Perl books, and a
widely sought-after speaker and trainer.

## Tuesday, October 10th - GitHub Continuous Integration for Perl CPAN modules

Tonight (*As an emergency substitute talk*) we will be having
a mini-hackathon on the `Config::Std` CPAN module that Boston.pm
maintains. We'll be offering a live demonstration of setting up
continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI and Appveyor, two hosted
CI tools made freely available for open source projects on GitHub.
Join us as we stumble through the process and learn from our mistakes.

Perl has had `Test::Harness` for decades, with CPANTS providing
distributed Continuous Integration testing of Released CPAN module
distributions for a decade or more. Thank you CPANTS volunteers for
creating a distributed cloud for us :-).  Now GitHub is offering
similar capabilities to all the other FLOSS communities via free
integration with freemium cloud Continuous Integration tools Travis-CI
(for Linux) and Appveyor (for Windows). Since we have CPANTS for
release, we can use Travis-ci&Appveyor to test our DEV branch after
check-in. They'll even test Pull Requests before merge!  Any GitHub
FLOSS project can use these, but Perl CPAN projects can make use
easily since we already have a regression testing culture, we won't
need to write the tests, just enable them.

## Nov. 14th - Adam Russell (live!) - "Deep Learning in Perl"

**LIVE Speaker !**

*Remember, if you get Veterans' Day Monday off work, Tuesday will feel
like Monday.*

**"Deep Learning with AI::MXNet: Navigating implementation issues"**

ABSTRACT
This talk will cover lessons learned from a recent experience in
getting a deep learning projected started, with little prior
experience in AI. All code will use the Perl MXNet API and guide the
audience through developing a simple model, which is then built on to
perform more complex tasks.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for a long time captured the popular
imagination. Results from academia and industry have finally started
to deliver on some of the long hoped for results: self driving cars,
automated medical diagnoses, and written and verbal language
processing. These areas are showing advances that were once simply
products of fiction writers. The current wave of AI enthusiasm may be
attributed to what is called Deep Learning which is a convenient label
for relatively new techniques using neural networks. The possibility
for increased automation across virtually every industry has resulted
in the spinning up of many new startup companies, as well as new
projects within existing enterprises, resulting in the need to develop
the skills necessary to pursue this new area.

While not the language of production, Perl is used to develop
algorithms and demonstrate concepts before they receive fuller
treatment. Deep Learning practitioners often begin their deep learning
work, correctly, with a review of the literature and research into the
fundamentals. Projects then often start confidently with high hopes,
built on that conceptual understanding, only to quickly get bogged
down in unforeseen, but critically important, issues of
implementation.


**Adam Russell** is a software engineer with OptumLabs' Center for Applied
Data Science (CADS). CADS is tasked with developing prototype
applications which implement recent advances in algorithms and
technology to address issues of importance to Optum business
interests. Most recent projects have been focused on Deep Learning.
Adam has a PhD in Computer Science from the University of
Massachusetts Lowell, his academic interests involve Computational
Geometry and Data Visualization and these explorations, much like the
work described in this talk, are all Perl driven. He also teaches, on
an adjunct basis, at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.

## December - Canceled

# 2018

## Jan 9th - ad hoc social in MIT hallway 

*room reservation failed due to IAP, so we had a social in the hallway.*

## Feb 13th 2nd Tuesday -- Commercial Game Design with Modern Perl -- Ovid builds a MMORPG in Perl

*topic originally scheduled for January*

**Amsterdam Perl Conference 2017 video screening**

Noted Perl personality **Ovid (Curtis Poe)** has built a Space-exploration
on-line role-playing-game called "Tau Station" in Perl. It's even a
business. In this talk, he describes the games industry and how Modern
Perl makes building his game fun.

Original Abstract -

"With Tau Station, we're building a sci-fi universe in a browser.
However, in object oriented design, what does the "single
responsibility principle" mean when your combat armor serves as armor,
a weapon, and medkit?

"And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated
requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit,
or refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do
you handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?

"And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe
drives almost everything?

"This talk explores some of the techniques we've developed for Tau
Station to easily model complex behaviors."

We'll have our usual community discussion after (or by hitting pause
as needed) in lieu of speaker Q&A.

## March - Winter Storm Watch no meeting

## April 10th (2nd Tuesday) - Federico Lucifredi / Hardware Hacking 101: time and randomness

**GPS! Randomness with Radiation!**

Abstract:
Using the lowest amount of custom hardware and pouring Perl over
everything as the glue binding it all, we create two minimalistic
devices delivering a perfectly tuned network time source
(synchronizing with a GPS satellite), and a naturally random entropy
source (leveraging a Geiger tube’s measurement of natural background
radiation).

## May 8th: shorts: Signatures and Precision


We'll watch (dissect?) two shorter conference videos, with our usual
MST3K commentary and rabbit-hole research. Topics are 3 dialects of
Function Signatures in  recent Perls and infinite precision
computation in Perl 6.

## June-August skipped

(1) August is canceled.

(2) We'll have a meeting in September; 2nd Tuesday is the 11th --
Where is TBD; maybe at MIT, maybe in Waltham.
If Waltham, it'll be near (T) bus and train as well as parking; and
I'll provide Car Pool out and or back for anyone that wants to.

(3) Our Wiki is down. Free provider has pulled the plug.
(In copious spare time, Tom and I are looking for right replacement.)
So temporarily boston.pm.org DNS points to a 404-ish page :-(


(4) Meantime, our Twitter, Facebook, G+ (*ominous music*), MeetUp, LinkedIn, and these
two Mailing Lists provide redundant communications.

**September 11th: Ricky Morse - Perl 6 and Typesetting Formal Announcements**

or, ***Ringing halfsheets with Perl 6***


*Meetings resume !         September at the usual place*

After ringing a bell for 45 minutes to 3 hours, you kind of want
people to know you did it, and what you did it for. Ricky uses Perl 6
to replace a manual process for creating “half-sheets” to post in the
Old North ringing room, for tourists to see.

Ricky sensibly doesn't want to retype or copy-paste what's already
somewhere on-line, so he uses Perl 6 to pull the data from a database
as XML, and then typeset the half sheets. This is using **Perl6, [GROFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_%28software%29),**
and **C6PAN Modules** `Template::Mustache`, `XML::XPath`, and `HTTP::User
Agent`.

*Commemorative text of a peal rung*
![Commemorative text of a peal rung](./images/BellRingHalfSheet.png)

Ricky gave background on the Change Ringing style of bell ringing and also briefly listed various software paths he considered to transform XML to PDF for this print problem.

## October 9th - Mark Fowler, "Perl Advent Calendar Redux" ( ROAD TRIP )

For the October 9 gathering of Boston Perl Mongers we'll be hosted by [MaxMind](https://web.archive.org/web/20181018073906/https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)  in Waltham, instead of our usual MIT location. Our speaker will be Mark Fowler.

(Boston.PM is happy to accept this offer of hosting from MaxMind, and would welcome hosting offers from other organizations in Eastern MA. It gives those who live further West or otherwise are unable/unwilling to travel to the city a chance to attend.

"A resource for beginners and advanced Perl users alike, the Perl Advent calendar <http://www.perladvent.org/2017/> features humourous stories featuring Santa's Elves and the fun they have with Perl. This talk will talk about all the exciting things that occurred in (*last*) year's calendar. Somewhat akin to twenty four two minute lighting talks, it'll expose you to a range of topics."

About the Speaker

**Mark Fowler** is a manager with experience in running teams developing, maintaining, and improving innovative internet based technologies, currently working for MaxMind, an industry-leading provider of IP intelligence and online fraud detection tools.. He has a strong background in programming and development, speaking at conferences, and writing technical articles. Author/maintainer of 32 modules on CPAN.



( *Boston.pm's Jerrad Pierce was the first Perl Advent interregnum editor after Mark's inaugural stint. We've not been involved in the 2nd interregnum or the Restoration, so it will be very good to hear this!* )

SITE: 14 Spring St, Waltham, MA 02451

(For CarFree folks, meeting will be on Express Bus / Bus network and short walk from Commuter Rail (transit map), or you can Carpool with Bill! Free parking across the street.)

-    556 & 553Express Buses (useful outbound only, last return service too early)
-    Fitchburg CR (Zone 2) Last inbound 1143PM to Porter (Red Line) & North Station (Green & Orange Lines)
-    70 regular bus (all night, to University Park via Central Sq Red Line; off rush 45 minutes)
-    170 Express Bus is reverse commute only express bus, so inapplicable to us - useful if working there and living in-town!

##  Wednesday, October 17, 2018 - QualityBox: a MediaWiki hosting service - BLU - Greg Rundlett

***Hosted by [BLU](https://blu.org) Boston Linux Unix***

Moderator: **Greg Rundlett,** founder of eQuality Technology

**A guided tour of QualityBox, a MediaWiki hosting service**

Abstract:

Greg Rundlett, founder of eQuality Technology, has created a hosted
software service called QualityBox which is provides the wiki engine
(MediaWiki) that drives Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, QualityBox is
instantly usable by the end-user. And like Wikipedia, it includes a huge
number of configurations, extensions and customizations that make it
supremely useful. Greg will take us on a tour of QualityBox, and the
MediaWiki ecosystem to illustrate some of the features and capabilities
that are available right “out of the box”.

Featuring:
-	MediaWiki 1.31 LTS
-	Visual Editor
-	ElasticSearch (v5.6.10)
-	Excellent Mobile support
-	Modern and traditional layouts
-	New dashboards
-	Top to Bottom security upgrades
-	Free SSL certificates
-	Subdomain-based wiki farms
-	And LOTS more.

(*Narrator: The BLU and Boston.PM wikis were hosted as the demos on QualityBox. Alas the business model fizzled by the end of 2021. It was nice while it lasted. The experimental multi-tenancy MediaWiki was a cool idea.*)

## November - Charlotte PM founded (by JChrome); No Boston meeting

## January 8th, 2019 - Perl Advent 2018 review

Ricky Morse will review the highlights of several of the Perl community Advent calendars of 2018.

Following up on Mark Fowler's Perl Advent 2017 review in October, Ricky takes on 3 of Advent calendars of 2018. 

[menu of select calendar pages](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2019-01-advent-roundup/index.html)

## February skipped



## March 12 - 25 years of Perl OO Evolution in one Hour (screening)

We stumbled on a video talk that provides a fast-forward review of how Perl's OO has evolved over the last 25 years.  We'll give that our MST3K commentary treatment.

## April 9 - Introducing Test2 (Chad Granum) - Ricky Morse (moderator)

[Test2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2) is a replacement for many of the Test modules, which comes 
with advanced comparison features, and a version of Ruby’s “SPEC” DSL.

Ricky screened **Chad Granum**’s [2018 Perl Conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2xIfBdcqb0) where 
he introduces the Test2 suite of modules. 

In addition, **Ricky** already had a bunch of tests written using Test2, 
which he showed from his iPad.


## May 14th - Jazzing up the output of Ack (a programmer's grep) with color - Bill Ricker

**Hue-Saturation-Luminance for Ack3 with Convert::Color::HSL and Term::ANSIColor**

Curious about how to handle different color spaces in Perl?

**Bill Ricker** will show how he improved RBG palette help for [**Ack3**](https://beyondgrep.com) using the HSL colorspace model and CPAN module that does HSL<->RGB transform.

Ack uses an  module [**`Term::ANSIColor`**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ANSIColor) that uses base-6 colors from 000 to 555 . 
`ack --help-rgb-colors` will display all possible colors.
The palette display was formerly laid-out as convenient for the code loop, not for the viewer's comprehension.

Reorganizing it according to a geometric color model makes it easier to see the various gradients between color coordinates. **Bill Ricker** used [**`Convert::Color::HSL`**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Convert::Color::HSL) to prototype a new palette-help, as seen in new [Ack3 code](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/blob/dev/dev/generate-rgb-codes.pl).


_The HSL model is very similar to the HSV model, with subtle distinction between "Luminance" and "Value" in the third, vertical coordinate:_

## June 11, E51-376 (Back to 3rd Floor) ¨Perl begat Perl¨ - Uri Guttman

They say only Perl can parse Perl, but Perl can also generate Perl. In "***Perl begat Perl***", a preview of a talk Uri will present at this year's Perl Conference, he will discuss how you can generate Perl inside Perl and then call eval on the code. Uri will explain why you might want to to use this technique, and illustrate it with good and bad examples.

**Uri Guttman** is a founding member of Boston Perl Mongers, a long time presence in the Perl community, and founder/owner of Stem Systems, a Perl consultancy, and known as "The Perl Hunter," a recruiter specializing in placing Perl talent.

[TPC Video of same talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMW1hCpP2Is) has abstract -

> Have you ever wondered why some CPAN modules actually generate Perl code to be eval'ed? Some of the reasons are simplicity but most often it is for getting faster running code. The key Perl feature used is eval on strings (the dangerous eval, not the safe eval of blocks). Newbies are always warned not to use string eval but this talk will show you why and how to use it for your benefit. Simple and common examples will be shown that anyone can use. Then more complex examples from existing CPAN modules (two of which are by the speaker) will be covered. They use Perl code generation for major speed gains (including 4x in one case).


NOTE:  Back to 3rd floor!

## October 8, MIT E51-376 - Conference Video Review - Sawyer X: future of Perl

Boston.pm will apply our MST3K interactive discussion style to one or more recent Conference Videos.

Couldn't make it to the last Perl Conference? In our next meeting (Tuesday, 10/8) we'll be viewing a keynote presentation from Sawyer X where he looks at what has transpired in the last 20 years, and then takes an honest and critical look at where the Perl 5 language stands today, and where it could go.

**how Perl 5.30 (2019) fits in arc of history and a possible future.**

but attendees can select a different one from shortlist or elsewhere for our interactive discussion (MST3K) treatment.

**LAST MEETING AT MIT - END OF AN ERA **


## March 9th - COVID hits Boston, meeting deferred 

*Out of an abundance of caution and not having a speaker anyway, I'm canceling the meeting this month.*

*I wouldn't be surprised if April has to be held as a Google Hangout or IRC meeting or something, as MIT may be a closed campus by then.*

(*And then MIT canceled all non-essential gatherings for the duration.*)

# The Virtual Era  2020-03-09 - Present

We held no virtual meetings during the hard months, and then we often skip summer, so by fall, 
we could see what Natick FOSS and BLU were doing for virtual meetings.

##  Sept 8th aka March 192nd - trial Virtual meeting 

Boston.PM will try a virtual meeting for September 8th
(aka March 192nd ).

Topic: **What did you do on your summer vacation?**  *WFH & staycation (with Perl¹)?*


* **Ricky Morse**, 10 minutes on `Set::Tiny` `Email::Stuffer` and `Text::CXV_XS` [notes](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2020-09-10minutes/index.html)
*  (*Narrator: Anyone else remember what they shared? No followups on list.*)


Where: JITSI 

¹ or other compatible, interesting FLOSS too

NOTE – This is as early as 2nd Tuesday can fall and is the day after the long Labor Day Weekend, so it will feel very Monday and not very Tuesday, let alone 2nd Tuesday !

We will use the Jitsi Meet service.


(If you need to hear my rant about why Zoom’s “fixes” are inadequate, ask me off-list.)

Jitsi is a Free/Libre OSS project sponsored by 8x8 (an Atlassian spin-off). It is the freemium base for their added-value corporate meeting & VOIP platform. As FLOSS, it can be self-hosted; they provide a free demo server. We will currently be using the free demo server, but may migrate to a hosted server (where we can set defaults, privileges).

Natick FOSS group has a 4-page Jitsi Help .pdf file, and you can practice beforehand.
(Natick meet 1st Thursdays, online, early afternoon)
Update to file ^ : Firefox latest versions 78+ support multicast, so are safer than before. Chrome/Chromium/FF78+ all plausible now.

One can use plain web mode, but if you can install the browser plug-in if you like. There are also iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android apps which work well.

(I will replace this line with the link to the meeting room later)

JITSI scales fine to more people in face-sharing Brady-Bunch / Hollywood Squares mode than you can easily see at once (30ish) and if folks turn off their cameras (same as mikes) when just listening/talking, i.e. when not commenting/presenting, it scales much higher.

(If we later get more folks than will comfortably fit in Jitsi, we can set up a stream to YouTubeLive or some other platform … or upgrade to a proper panelist platform feeding a stream, but the “seminar” quality of Jitsi is fine for our level of anarchy.)

I will routinely mute those not presenting so you’ll usually need to unmute to comment.
Hint: Space-bar is push to talk, M is mute/unmute
(on phone/tablet it’s the skewmorphic microphone, avoid the handset hangup button!).

## Charlotte PM : Wed 28th, : Command Line Adventures in Perl - 2021 Edition - Jason Crome  (Joint Virtual Meeting)

*Our first Joint Virtual Meeting*

Boston.PM is invited to join **Charlotte PM**'s virtual meeting this Wednesday night, April 28th, 6PM EDT.

**Command Line Adventures in Perl - 2021 Edition**
 
Command line interfaces are an important part of managing many modern applications, and in 2021, there are no shortage of options for building them in Perl. In this talk, Jason will summarize many of the current options available, with an overview of the pros and cons of each. From there, he will explore how to construct a complex command line interface using CLI::Osprey, based on his recent experiences rebuilding the Dancer2 CLI.

**Jason Crome** is a longtime veteran of Perl and its community, is the TPF Grants Committee Secretary, and a member of the Dancer Core Team. He's currently a contractor at Bank of America building and maintaining payment processing systems with Perl and C++.

## June 16 (Joint Charlotte PM) - Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda talks Slashdot, Perl, moderation, and more!

*Boston.PM is invited to again join Charlotte PM's virtual meeting*

**Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda talks Slashdot, Perl, moderation, and more!**

*Hosted by Jason C. & Charlotte Perl Mongers*

Join us on June 30th for a special event featuring **Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda,** founder of **Slashdot,** as he talks about the quirkiness of Perl that led them to build Slashcode using our favorite language, the challenges of scaling Slashdot in the early days, and how they built up a system to deal with bad actors. We will leave time for Q&A at the end, but feel free to send your questions in advance of the talk.

**Rob Malda, aka CmdrTaco,** founded Slashdot in his dorm room at Hope College in the late 1990s, and with that, broke new ground in news aggregation and social content moderation. He's also the host of Geeks in Space, and a a maker of wooden pens.

Thanks to **Knowmad** (https://knowmad.com) for sponsoring our Zoom presence for this meeting, and to Boston.pm for cohosting the meeting with us. (*And thanks to Charlotte PM for arranging this and inviting us!*)

NOTE: Our speaker has asked that you leave your cameras on for this event. Also, he has a hard stop at 7:30, so please be prompt. There will be time for socializing after the talk. Look forward to seeing you all! 


(*Historical note: SlashDot was - still is! - an early Social Media website; it's platform SlashCode was Perl. [Boston.PM's founder Chris "Pudge" Nandor](./History-01-Reconstructed-1999.html#the-innocent-era---prior-to-regular-meetings) was an early employee after it got investment.*)

## October 27th (Wednesday) - Cross-platform Flutter - Joint with Charlotte PM - Randal L Schwartz

**Why you should take a good look at Flutter for all platforms!**

[**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev) has come a long ways since its was first introduced a few years ago. Yes, even though Google is still in the driver’s seat for Flutter and Dart development, more and more of the contributions are coming from the community.

Google is highly committed to continuing to make Flutter the go-to SDK for user interfaces of all kinds. Of course it still does Mobile well (ios/android/fuchsia), but recently, major releases for Flutter on Web, Flutter on Desktop (linux, windows, macos), and Dart on every platform (including compiling go-like to a single binary with everything included) have continued to please the crowds.

Many large organizations have adopted Flutter, and some app-store apps have had literally millions of downloads.

I’ll be talking about the **Past, Present, and Future of Flutter and Dart.**

Topics covered:

  - What is Flutter anyway, and why Dart?
  - How does it compare to other multi-platform UI SDKs?
  - Flutter/Dart – past, present, future
  - Platforms Notable adopters
  - Q&A if there’s time

Where - Online event hosted by Charlotte.PM

When - Wed, Aug 25, 2021, 6:00 PM ET 

(*This repeated for [BLU in Feb 2022](http://blu.org/cgi-bin/calendar/2022-feb) which will have archived **video** and **slides**.*)

##  Wednesday, February 23, 2022 - Developing a caching plugin for HTTP::Tiny - Mark Gardner 

In 2015, Mark Gardner developed a caching subclass of **`LWP::UserAgent`**. This month, he is going to talk about his journey in converting that to a plugin using **perlancar's `HTTP::Tiny::Plugin`**.

**Mark Gardner** is a professional Perl developer with over twenty-five years experience in various industries including pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, and web hosting. For the past year he’s been writing weekly at phoenixtrap.com about Perl-related topics, helping other developers engineer modern, disciplined applications with confidence.

## March 8th - Virtual Round Table 

## April 12th - Downloading AO3 bookmarks for offline reading - Ricky Morse

"continuation of my 'let me make sure I can entertain myself when I'm 90' series."

**Ricky Morse**

Ricky has previously shown us Perl scripts to make offline backups of various media he'd like to see again (without relying on the continued solvency of Archive.org).
This will be another variation.

## Wed May 4th (with Charlotte PM) - Semantically-Friendly DB Searches - D Ruth Holloway

In her quest for more-readable code, **D Ruth Holloway** has been working on some [DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2) plugins for smoother, more semantically-friendly database searches. As a preview to her TPRC::Houston talk in June, come see these modules, and learn how to use them to make your own database queries faster, smarter, and easier to read.

(*This was a Preview of [Conference Talk re-titled "The Database Dance - DBIX and Dancer treachery to increase performance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4H_DpewCws), which has following abstract.*)

> Writing web applications with DBIx::Class and Dancer2 is super-easy. Learning how to make them efficient takes a little longer. Come see some of the things that Ruth has learned—and created—that make these apps faster and easier to maintain.

> Writing inefficient applications is startlingly easy to do; some of my early Dancer2 work shows it! In this talk, we’ll discuss ways to structure queries and code to speed things up, and show some of the tools that are available for Dancer2 and DBIx::Class that make maintaining these systems just a bit easier.

> Ruth has been writing Perl for 21 years, and attending Perl conferences for the last ten years, speaking at all but one of the in-person conferences. She is a big fan of DBIx::Class, Dancer2, and Agile programming without all the ceremonies. Ruth is a wife, writer, cook, autoharpist, and mommy to the cutest dog you will ever meet.

## May 10th Using Perl's Twitter::API - Bill R

**Bill Ricker**, inspired by Ricky's talk on archival web scraping last month, revisits the
**[`Twitter::API`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Twitter::API)**.

One script is a daemon used to automatically retweet useful announcements posted to a monitored Twitter account. The other will archive a Twitter thread in text format (and can safely be re-run when the tread gets longer). It avoids depending on a 3rd party service, which use tracking, ads, and might disappear, to host the archived thread.

(My sample script is quite tuned to the [thread](https://twiter.com/elevennames/status/1509876985744355329) I wished to archive, as it heuristically extracts proper nouns.)

## May 25th (hosted by Charlotte PM) Richard Hipp Talks About All Things SQLite

(*May appear on Charlotte PM YouTube eventually.*)

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Richard_Hipp>

"SQLite is an SQL database engine that can be used in applications as a library for quick read-write operations. Unlike other database management systems, SQLite is not a client-server database designed to run in a data center. D. Richard Hipp is the architect and primary author of SQLite and the Fossil SCM." - [S E Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/11/13/sqlite-with-d-richard-hipp/)

## June July August Canceled for Summer

## 2d Tuesday, Sept 13, What's new in Perl 5.036 

A group discussion of the latest [`perldelta`](https://perldoc.perl.org/5.36.0/perldelta) - which prepares for October's future of Perl OO.

We reviewed

* <https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/09/08/this-is-not-your-grandfathers-perl/>
* [PumpKing RJBS musings](https://rjbs.cloud/blog/2022/05/perl-5.36/)
* [`perldelta`](https://perldoc.perl.org/5.36.0/perldelta)

***Highlights***

* signatures graduate from experimental
* `try` + `catch` + `finally` + `defer`
* `use v5.36`  is (almost) sufficient boilerplate (almost = new experimentals need `use` )
* n-at-a-time iteration
* `builtin::` Experimental namespace


***Other Mentions***

* [Petit Parser](https://petitparser.github.io/) vs Marpa parser ([CPAN](https://metacpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/view/pod/Marpa_R2.pod), [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08129), [home](https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/) )
* [DiffTool that knows what you mean](https://hackaday.com/2022/09/10/diff-tool-knows-what-you-mean/)
* The D language has a [Schwartz_Sort](https://dlang.org/library/std/algorithm/sorting/schwartz_sort.html) ... which they did NOT tell Randal [when he interviewed them.](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly/episodes/311)

## Tuesday, Oct 11, 7pm ET &#127482;&#127480; Boston PM: OPEN DISCUSSION

A good discussion was had but i didn't take notes.

Randal (Merlyn) , Dan (swagg boi), Jerrad, Bill.

## Wednesday Oct 26th, 6pm ET  &#127482;&#127480;  - Charlotte PM - Baking backend: a study - Yanick

Writing backends doesn't have to be a pain in, well, there too.

Yanick ~will~ share*d* how he's building the backend of **smol** -- a site showcasing painted miniatures -- leveraging **sveltekit**, **svelte-query**, **openapi** and **JSON:API** to achieve maximal self-documentation and consistency with as little boilerplate as possible. We'll see how the backend endpoints are built, how they can be documented as painlessly as possible, and how they can be plugged in on the fronting web application with minimal effort and no code duplication.

(*warning: presentation contains no Perl. But there will be a healthy helping of TIMTOWTDI*)

Yanick has been using Perl for, uh, let's go for "a while". Erstwhile member of the core Dancer team, past co-editor of the Perl Weekly, ex-contributor to the Perl Review, he has 103 distributions to his name on CPAN, which is frankly a tad excessive. He works at Infinity Interactive.

## Tuesday, February 14th &#x1F498; , 6:30 PM &#127482;&#127480; Boston PM: `match::smart`, `match::simple` - Toby Inkster (live)

With P5P actively moving forward from deprecation to Warning and eventual removal of the v5.10 SmartMatch `~~` operator -- for good reason, it was underspecified, nondeterministic, and outright dangerious -- there's a question for those who found a subset of its capabilities useful. Prolific module author [Toby Inkster](https://metacpan.org/author/TOBYINK) provides a safe, deterministic subset of smart-match in [`match-simple`](https://metacpan.org/dist/match-simple) distribution which provides  [`match::simple`](https://metacpan.org/pod/match::simple) and [`match::smart`](https://metacpan.org/pod/match::smart)  with optional [XS accelerator](https://metacpan.org/dist/match-simple-XS).

(*with apologies to anyone who has other plans that &#x1F498; evening. this is the risk of 2d Tuesday scheduling.*)

**Toby Inkster** is a consultant for The Perl Shop. 
He has been working as a software developer for over 20 years, 
focusing on databases, the Web, and the places where they overlap. 
Toby has contributed to popular Perl open source libraries such as 
the light-weight object-oriented programming tool Moo,
as well as being the lead developer of Type::Tiny. 
He has an interest in the Semantic Web was an invited expert to the W3C RDFa 
Working Group. He also enjoys cooking and likes cats.

`match::simple` and `match::smart` are survivable substitutes for the deprecated `~~` smartmatch operator, either as a fake operator or as a callable routine renamed to caller's convenience.  The 'simple' variant has predictable semantics; the 'smart' variant emulates (nearly) the full inconceivable complexity of the deprecated `~~`, which provide a survival path for some code.


```
use v5.10;
use match::simple;
 
if ( $this |M| $that ) {
   say "$this matches $that";
}
```

When asked if he also provided a substitute for the `given ... when ...` keywords, he replied not currently (syntax module he'd used has been deprecated), but it's not hard to do, e.g.:

Just recently in mid February 2023, Ovid and Paul again shared exciting news: P5P's upcoming development release Perl 5.37.9 (alpha/beta for 5.40.0) will contain  
 **`use feature 'class';`**  
It has been merged.

Ovid is the architect and Paul is the lead developer for adding a new object-oriented system called Corinna† (formerly & confusingly "Cor" into Perl 5 Core. They've had an open community process to develop an RFC or proposal and prototype, but until recently, without commitment for the Perl 5 Porters (P5P) to actually implement it in Perl 5. Over the summer, P5P have approved the initial Stage 1 integration into Perl Core. While we've had 20+ years of new OO packages for Perl5 since 5.0, this is the first actual (as opposed to proposed) overhaul of the *core* OO system in Perl 5.

PEVANS's non-Core, prototype is [Object::Pad](https://metacpan.org/dist/Object-Pad), which can be conditionally imported in compatibility mode via [Feature::Compat::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class).

Ovid's recent writing on Corinna are [on his blog](https://ovid.github.io/tags/corinna.html).

The [Corinna project](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor) has a  [wiki](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki) and the [RFC](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor#rfc) that proposed adding Corinna to Perl 5 Core, and the P5P-accepted Stage 1 [Minimal Viable Product RFC](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/rfc/mvp.md). [His 2021 editorial](https://dev.to/ovid/bringing-modern-oo-to-perl-51ak) explains the difference between Moose (*et al*), Stevan Little's Moxie, and Corinna.

***Damian Conway*** posted an exultation for the (January 2022) P5P approval of the Stage 1 MVP RFC _but i can't find it again_. His previous writings endorsing the project are

## May 9th, Using `MP3::Tag` & `Syntax::Keyword::Try` etc to make playable audio archives with legible titles 

In pre-meeting **Jarred** discussed [SIGBlovik: The Association for Computational Heresy](http://sigbovik.org/), a parody computer science special-interest group, which has paper and [video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sigbovik) proceedings, in particular [ GradIEEEnt half decent: The hidden power of imprecise lines ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae9EKCyI1xU). And [**Randal**](https://www.youtube.com/c/RandalLSchwartzonDartandFlutter) previewed the release of [Dart 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29)/[Flutter 3.10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_%28software%29) later this week.

Since I (Bill) failed to cancel the meeting or line up something better, we dove into my Backup Topic.

### Using `MP3::Tag` & `Syntax::Keyword::Try` etc to make playable audio archives with legible titles 

This [script (Tidy html)](./scripts/mp3info.pl.html) ([`mp3info.pl` (raw)](./scripts/mp3info.pl)) exists to (a) scratch an immediate itch and (b) experiment with a few modules. No claim is made to best usage of any of these features! The Itch was scratched, and pudding was proofed.

The Itch was that in moving old podcast files off a modest M.2 SSD to archival spinning rust drive (which is normally kept Read-only mounted for safety), I did not want to rely on Rhythmbox or other music/pod player being sane about browsing/playing a read-only drive where it couldn't mark things PLAYED. I did need to move most of my older mp3, ogg, etc collection that wasn't "in queue" to larger passive storage to make space. But i didn't want to lose the ability to search by track title etc, which usually aren't fully encoded in filenames. As i expected, there's a CPAN module for accessing mp3 etc meta-data tags. So it should be trivial to recursively write HTML indices for directories containing MP3s, with links that will play a file, right? 

(_more commentary is in the linked file._)

## Tuesday, April 9th, 2024 - using new Class syntax

While I was able to chase the Eclipse, I didn't get caught in traffic, so surprise, meeting held.

The topic is Dave Cross's recent CPAN upload [**Amazon::Sites**](https://metacpan.org/pod/Amazon::Sites ) [0.1.6](https://metacpan.org/release/DAVECROSS/Amazon-Sites-0.1.6/source/README.md) that makes good use of the Ovid=Curtis and PEVANS=Leonerd's new experimental built-in  [`feature class` syntax](https://perldoc.perl.org/feature#The-'class'-feature) (via the compatible wrapper [Feature::Compat::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class)) and `signatures` to make a real-world useful CPAN ojbect using latest Perl features. Dave Cross got some help in FB "The Perl Community" :

[Request for Help](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/posts/1639477536859866/)

> **Dave Cross**  
> I released a new CPAN module called `Amazon::Sites`. It uses `Feature::Compat::Class` and subroutine signatures. And CPAN testers tells me that it is failing to compile on Perl 5.24. It looks like the failure is because of my use of signatures - but they were introduced in Perl 5.20, so I can't see what the problem is.

> **Leon Timmermans**  
> Yeah, if you want to use signatures in `Object::Pad` methods you need 5.26. This issue is not solvable as earlier perls don't provide the underlaying primitives needed to implement this.

It's a very simple set of 2 classes (a collection class and a single-thing instances class) that solves a real problem without needing features that aren't in the experimental core `feature class` yet.

### When is a JAPH not a JAPH

**Fediverse (Mastodon etc) has `#perl` activity**.  A delightful not-just-a-JAPH showed up today.

[Serpent7776 2024-04-09](https://mastodon.social/@Serpent7776/112242749915834369)

> Definitely don't run this random #perl code

```
my@a=sub{my@a=@_;
map{(-10, -12, 86, 56, -82, -5, -82, 1, 73, 54, -13, -70)[$_]+$a[$_]} 0..11
}->((unpack("C*", 'rm -rf')) x 2);my@w=(0x64, 0x61, 0x79);
print eval "'" . pack("C*", @a) . pack("C*", @w) . "\n'";
```

[Apr 09, 2024, 14:47](https://mastodon.social/@Serpent7776/112242749915834369)

_yes it looks scary, but that's just raw characters being reprocessed to pring something friendly._

This reminded Randal of a [JAPH he perpetrated](https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1198781) a long time ago, the `oh, turtleneck Phrase Jar!`, which abused `tr` to transpose an anagram rather than transliterate.

### Eclipse 2024 discussion
And we of course compared our **Eclipse experiences** the prior day.  I (Bill) opted for 97% in Mom's driveway — celebrating memory of her taking me to Grandfather's for Eclipse of 1963 — and concentrated on the experience rather than photography but got a [few photos](https://pixelfed.social/i/web/post/683385129870968035).  I got 140 minutes between 1st and 4th contact.  The 3% Maximum period was perhaps longer than Totality for those there, and was differently fascinating; the remnant sliver seemingly rotated **around** the shadow as the shadow slowly shifted across the sun's disk from pseudo-2nd-contact to pseudo-3rd-contact. NASA posted an image showing this from [Washington DC](https://nasa.tumblr.com/post/747233450847862785/follow-follow-the-sun-and-which-way-the-wind).
![Eclipse-washington-monument-nasa](images/Eclipse-washington-monument-nasa.png)

  NOAA as usual posted an animation of the eclipse [Penumbra (the broader partial eclipse shadow) crossing the continent](https://vis.social/@joemurph/112237534904015218) [hires Y-T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoDBHIlY9FA)
[Friends of Nasa](https://www.friendsofnasa.org/2024/04/solar-eclipse-2024-high-res-orbital.html) has some low-orbit close-ups too, as does [space.com](https://www.space.com/solar-eclipse-2024-satellite-moon-shadow-video-photos). 

Space(.)com pub'd a NASA image shot from [ISS that's a "closeup" of Quebec + Maine](https://www.space.com/solar-eclipse-2024-satellite-moon-shadow-video-photos) in shadow (Penumbra; Totality or Umbra is the thin densest core).

## Tuesday June 11th, 2024 - Perl 5.40 released ! 


Since the [Perl Weekly 672](https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-weekly-672-its-time--2dab) and other channels have announed release of **Perl v5.40**, let's dive in and see what's new.  A lot of stuff previously experimental is now stable, as well as some new-new stuff.

Bill, Jerrad, Ricky, Mike S, Chuba

* https://metacpan.org/release/HAARG/perl-5.40.0

## Tuesday July 9th, 2024 - Bill's `feature class` proof of concept and ensuing discussion

I've been experimenting with Perl v5.40's **`feature class`** and prototype `Object::Pad` and some recently updated modules, e.g. `Data::Enum` latest supports `match::simple::sugar` which together provide a replacement for what I liked in the doomed `given-when` hypermatch. `Getopt::Declare` isn't exactly recent but I like it. `Perl::MinimumVersion`'s `perlver` is also cool. 

* `feature class` introduced in Perl v5.38 has two major improvements [`:reader`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlclass#:reader) and [`__CLASS__`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perldelta#New-__CLASS__-Keyword), which make it reasonably fun to use.
* [`Feature::Compat::Class`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class) provides a simple invocation of `feature class` if running Perl v5.38+ or [`Object::Pad`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad) if not. 
    * if prototyping in Object::Pad not just falling-back to, need to add `:strict(params)` to detect incorrect constructor keys; not permitted/not needed in `feature class`.
* [`Data::Enum`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Enum) recently revved to add a hook for [`match::simple::sugar`](https://metacpan.org/pod/match::simple::sugar) compatibility so that a variable containing a singleton `Data::Enum` value be matched against strings in a `for-when` block. (I do like that the enum is implemented as a set of singletons.)
    ```
    LINE: while (<>){
    SWITCH: for ($STATE){
        when 'none', then { … };
        when 'header', then { … };
        when 'line', then { … };
        }
    }
    ```
* My suggestions *`match::simple::sugar`* documentation*, [issues from lessons learned](https://github.com/tobyink/p5-match-simple/issues).
        * `no feature 'switch';  # or use v5.36; or greater` to avoid deprecation warning and resulting syntax fail
        * my other documentation issues / lessons learned:
            * when using `match::simple::sugar` (with `Data::Enum` that now supports `match::simple` !), when nesting the switch `for () { when ..., then{}; ...}` non-looping loop block within an outer `for()`, `foreach()` or `while(<>){}` actual loop _~as one does~_, whether as an event loop or per-line-input loop, there are three implications that should be documented; one of which might be fixable in module code.

1. the outer loops must use a named loop variable, or (minimally invasive) have a local `my $line=$_;` just before the `SWITCH: for when`, and any and all implicit `m{}`, `//`, _etc_ or explicit references to `$_` must be changed to `$line =~ m{}`.

2. outer and inner loops need `LINE: while(<>){...}` and `SWITCH: for ($STATE){when ..` statement labels, as `when...then` will do `next` on the inner `for` as if it were a loop, so script's own loop control `next`, `redo`, `last` must name `next LINE;`.

3. to avoid a ~flurry nay~ blizzard of `Exiting subroutine via next at` warnings on STDERR, must insert `no warnings 'exiting';` after `SWITCH: for ($var){`  .

* I would _not_ put the `no warnings` outside the for-when lexical block, so as to not block warnings caused by other errors.  It might be practical to inject the `no warnings 'exiting';` into the anon-subs made from the `then {block}` ?

* (Near as i can tell, there's no danger of an innermost loop inside the `then{}` clause having a problem, as the hidden `next SWITCH` by the `when` occurs after the `then{}` anon sub returns to `when`, if i don't `next LINE;` out of it.)

* Additional warning required, that **`return`** in the `then {BLOCK}` won't do what is expected, but rather returns from the `when-then` anon-sub (lambda).

* Would need to return up the call stack to return from my visible sub.

* (Instead i just have a `$ret` value the way we used to do when one in one out structured programming forbade return from anywhere except the bottom of the subroutine. )
* (Aside: Probably helped that I'm old enough to have suffered under that formalism. Which did let us reason over programs, and I have proved several production loops correct according to precondition, invariant, progress, postcondition, which benefited from no early exits / no gotos. But readable code is more useful most of the time. 🤣 )



* [`perlver`](https://metacpan.org/release/DBOOK/Perl-MinimumVersion-1.42-TRIAL/view/script/perlver) reads your script or collection of modules and reports what is required to run it - both by checking explicit demand but what is actually used. It's not perfect yet, [we're hammering edge-cases](https://github.com/neilb/Perl-MinimumVersion/issues). If you like Postderef as I do, get the DEV version 1.42-TRIAL version not the 1.40 current 'production' version, if that is still current when you read this.

Comments

* Ricky notes I could use new built-in `weaken` and `trim` if commiting to v5.40 rather than using `Feature::Compat::Class`
(`trim` is ok for this app as replacement from `chomp; chop if /\r\z/;` as mandatory id at front doesn't allow for leading spaces)

* Jerrad notes `perl -CA` handles @ARGV decoding [perlunicookbook](https://www.perl.com/pub/2012/04/perlunicookbook-decode-argv-as-utf8.html/) . Jerrad says:(Quoth perlrun "Note: Since perl 5.10.1, if the -C option is used on the #! line, it must be specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter." In which case it seems like -C w/o 1, 2 or 4 place set should be safe on shebang only, and esp. the 32s place. Tis a shame the interpreter doesn't differentiate.)

* Ricky mentioned **Damian Conway** included reimplemnenting keywords, including smartmach `given` and `when`,  in his recent keynote at **@YAPCNA The Perl and Raku Conference - Las Vegas, NV 2024** 
[**The Once and Future Perl**- Damian Conway - TPRC 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x9LD8oOmv0&pp=ygUja2V5bm90ZSBvbmNlIGFuZCBmdXR1cmUgcGVybCBjb253YXk%3D)
    * He also discuss how he helped Ovid with prototyping of Corina class with PPR.
    * Damian's [Switch::Back](https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch::Back) module reimplements the bad smartmatch-given-when 
        * if it only had 6 rules, not 46, maybe it wouldn't have to die?
        * *now* that Perl has canonical true values, can make simpler rules, only slight change in behavior, [Switch::Right](https://metacpan.org/dist/Switch-Back) 
    * All **Damian Conway** 2024 Keynote modules:
        * [Switch::Right](https://metacpan.org/dist/Switch-Right)
            * depends: `B::Deparse` `Keyword::Simple` `Multi::Dispatch` **`Object::Pad`** `PPR` **`Test2::V0`** `Type::Tiny`
        * [Switch::Back](https://metacpan.org/dist/Switch-Back)
            * depends: `B::Deparse` `Keyword::Simple` **`Multi::Dispatch`** `PPR` `Test::More` `Type::Tiny`
        * [Multi::Dispatch](https://metacpan.org/dist/Multi-Dispatch)
            * depends: `Algorithm::FastPermute` `Data::Dump` **`Keyword::Simple`** **`PPR`** `Test::More` `Type::Tiny` 
        * [Filter::Syntactic](https://metacpan.org/dist/Filter-Syntactic) 
            * depends: `Filter::Simple` **`PPR`** `Test::More`
        * [DWIM::Block](https://metacpan.org/dist/DWIM-Block) can reimplement Coy 
            * depends: `AI::Chat` **`Filter::Simple` `PPR`** `Test::More`
        * [PPR](https://metacpan.org/dist/PPR) {updated}
        * older, referenced [Keyword::Declare](https://metacpan.org/dist/Keyword-Declare)


* Randal says:there's an interesting anecdote about underscore prefix in early releases of Perl. Making `$_` visible in every package context initially made *every* private `$_variable` very very public.

* Ricky asked if `Data::Dump dd` dumps new class objects ok; I think passably.  Ricky says: This claims to support dumping new objects:  [Data::Printer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Printer).

## August 

We usually cancel August due to vacations, and we did so again

## Tuesday September 10th

We had a chat, but I don't think i took notes?

Tabs left open appear to be

* [GitHub Pages for Perl developers](https://perlmaven.com/github-pages-for-perl-developers)
* [How to pass JSON using WWW::Mechanize in perl](https://perl.theplanetarium.org/)
* [MOM Macros for Gnu Troff](https://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-05.html)
    * and other Troff matters such as [Randal's mods to O'Reilly's book macros](https://www.facebook.com/merlyn/posts/pfbid02HuoV9aVa1GWrNpJdgeC9Zg9PyvUuB7o5VGygSLVWSU1dWLZS6Lfym7TQrRagxcvXl)
* [Ladino Kantoniko](https://github.com/kantoniko/)


## Tuesday October 8th 

* Randal reports [Audo Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) for Mac lets him do a demonic voice for halloween, shift down one octave.
* discussion of headsets, batteries
* difficulties of finding LLM/AI tools (e.g. text summarizing, voice call summarizing) that promise they won't include your data in next training cycle and thus respect data confidentiality.
* Christos Argyropoulos, a scientific Perl user seen on [FB Perl Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/498667124274252/user/654377198) etc, [Fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/@christosargyrop.bsky.social@bsky.brid.gy), ... posted a reflection the classic _Higher Order Perl_ ([MJD's HOP](https://hop.perl.plover.com/)) book in light of \^recent\^ advances in Perl to [Blogs.Perl.Org](https://blogs.perl.org/users/chrisarg/2024/07/caching-memoization-with-state-variables.html) {has comments} and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/chrisarg/caching-memoization-with-state-variables-18dm) {has prettier code highlighting}. His example was Fibonacci using initialized `state` variables vs module `Memoize`.   BPO comments note that with Memoize, one can use a single implementation to create both Fibonacci and [Lucas](https://oeis.org/wiki/Lucas_numbers) sequences, but not with a named sub with one hidden state variable used by all uses, interesting edge case. {_n.b. the s in Lucas is silent._}
* A new IDE for Perl appeared as [Yet another senseless pet project](https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/posts/1769236873883931/) [App::Codit](https://metacpan.org/release/HANJE/App-Codit-0.10/source/README.md)
* Jerrad wonders if since it uses Tk graphics it would be possible to integrate the existing [ptkdb](https://ptkdb.sourceforge.net/) debugger?
* Jerrad has been dealing with aligning data collected as [NECTA: New England city and town area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_city_and_town_area) vs [CBSA:Core-based statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core-based_statistical_area), County vs [Zipcode ZCTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code_Tabulation_Area). Yet more [Falsehoods Programmers Believe](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood) that need to be regularly debunked. 


## November 12th - 7.30 pm EDT topic start 

* I have no notes. IIRC I had a nice chat with Randal.
