Tech Meetings have traditionally held on the 2nd Tuesday of every month, most recently at MIT.

# The MIT Era 2005-08-09 - 2020-03-09 (part 1: 2005-2016)

For 15 years, MIT IT and Facilities provided user group meeting space on campus for the convenience of MIT staff and other community members who wished to attend.

The facilities were very nice MBA case rooms in the Business & Humanities building E51.

*MIT Era spans the file break between this Part i and and [Part ii](History-03-Email.html), due to source of information. This file is extracted from 2-3 generations of Wiki Calendar Archives.

## December 13th - Christmas Lights Tour - *Bill & Greek Chorus*

A mutually-guided tour of the first half of several Perl-ish Advent Calendars
[![XmasLights33.png](./images/XmasLights33.png)](./documents/Xmas-Lights.pdf)

Around this time of year there is a tradition in the programming
communities to share our favorite libraries, tools, and tips we've
gathered over the past year. These prizes are dolled out once per day
in classic Advent Calendar style. In the next Boston.pm meeting we'll
take a look at the highlights from several in-progress Perl-related
calendars, including:
 
* Perl Advent (classic Perl 5)
* Perl6 Advent
* Dancer
* C::Blocks Advent (a whole calendar for a single module in Beta !?)

and maybe more from the master list via [Advent Planet ](http://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/2016/index.html)which has other languages and sysadmin, perf, ..., and a code based puzzles.
 
(Audience participation: As usual, our Greek chorus answers each other's questions about the modules seen.)

## NO NOVEMBER meeting

2nd Tuesday in November in a Leap year is Election Day - 
I presume most people will be watching a different channel that night. 

We often do social in December.
 
## Tues Oct 11th, room E51-376 Bill Ricker, Perl 5.22 & Abe Lincoln's War Cipher

Last month, I did my usual Cryptographic History talk before BLU.org's GPG/PGP key-signing. 
The title was "*Transposition Cyphers in Historic Context*", 
looking at a theory and two specific uses, President Lincoln and German Army Corps WW1. 
As usual, there was a bit of Perl code used for demonstration - for Lincoln's.
 
This time, I used the 5.020 experimental features, **`postderef`** and **`signatures,`**
that we've discussed in new release feature reviews (both promoted to stable in 5.024, so safe to use in real code).

 
![a Lincoln telegram](./images/Telegram.png)

BLU saw the history, but this month, Boston.pm gets to see the code.

## Tues Sept 13th, room E51-376 - Brendan Gregg's FlameGraphs (Bill Ricker, moderator)
![FlameGraph of cpu of mysql](./images/Cpu-mysql-crop-250.png)

I stumbled on a link to a set of posts and hand-drawn [**'zines'**](https://wizardzines.com/) about Linux
debugging and 'doing' software at .
The Linux Debugging zine includes several 'old friend' tools (which
gives me confidence in this person's opinions) and also included new
or new to me options and tools, and specifically enthused over **Brendan
Gregg's invention: FlameGraphs.**

**Brendan Gregg** invented these to make sense of profile stack samples of
MySQL, which produced so much data that he had to invent a new way to
visualize ... with Perl, naturally. Tim Bunce has bundled and enhanced
FlameGraphs into CPAN NYTProf, but it's usable with any profiler
giving full stack traces with symbols (Dtrace, perf, SystemTrap, OS X
Instruments, Xperf.exe, NYTProf for Perl). -Bill Ricker

We will watch a video by the author and play with the source code.

## March 8th - Rakudo Perl 6 and MoarVM Performance Advances - J. Worthington

(By the magic of video - Yapc::EU)
 
> "Performance has long been one of the blockers to greater adoption of
Perl 6. The language is designed in expectation of a sufficiently smart
optimizer, knowing that such things are possible - but setting quite a
challenge for those of us working on Perl 6 implementation.
> Following the "make it work, then make it fast" approach, we've done a
lot of work over the years on getting many language features to work well
in Rakudo. ... In this session I'll discuss how we've been improving Perl
6 performance by working at all levels of the implementation: optimizing
built-ins, improving the Perl 6 optimizer's ability to simplify code,
and building a powerful dynamic optimizer for MoarVM that uses run-time
information about a program's typical behavior to cheapen attribute
accesses, resolve dispatches, eliminate type checks, perform inlining,
and much more. I'll also take a look at the MoarVM JIT project, and how
that is helping.

![benchmark](./images/benchmark.png)
 
> Finally, I'll take stock of where we're at so far using latest benchmark results: what we can do about as well as Perl 5, where Perl 5 comes out faster, and where Rakudo Perl 6 comes out ahead."

## Feb 9th, - Parallelism, Concurrency, and Asynchrony in Perl 6. - Jonathan Worthington

Lead Dev of Rakudo Perl 6 and founder&architect of MoarVM (appearing via tape delay)

> "Parallelism and concurrency are different, though often
confused. Asynchrony adds yet another concept into the mix. And there
are dozens of different approaches to working with these concepts. How
do we identify what kind of problem we're dealing with, and pick an
approach to solving it?
>  "In this session, I'll look at a range of different problems - some
parallel, some concurrent - and show the approaches that may be taken
to solve them. And, since I've been working on the Perl 6 parallelism
and concurrency features, I'll show how these solutions look in Perl 6."
 
... and any comments from anyone who's downloaded it and messed with it since Sixmas ....
 
(Note, word is if you had an old RakudoBrew, [it needs removal and re-clone for the release](http://www.learningperl6.com/2016/02/06/dont-install-over-your-existing-perl-6).)
 
 
 
## January 12th 2016, CANCEL DUE TO WEATHER
 


# 2015 

## Autumn Theme: Perl 6 for Xmas is "Sixmas"
 
## December 8th, 20115 Perl 6 Grammars - It's a RegEx, a Parser, and a Dessert Topping (Perl 6 is almost here: Part 3)

We have two short, recent videos each with example code on one of the
key improvements P5→P6, moving Parse-Rec-Descent into the guts as
P6 Grammars.

This is possibly the feature that will drive earliest Perl6 production
deployments. (IIRC, years ago Dan told us it already happened!)

Demos Explained -
 
* App::p6tags - Generate editor tags for perl6.
* Syntax colorizing code in a presentation with P6

( If anyone knows of a demo of logic programming or 'Eliza bot' in Perl6 grammars, let me know so we can include it. -- bill )
 

 
## November 10, 2015 - "Get Ready To Party" (Perl 6 is almost here: Part 2)

**Larry Wall** (appearing by tape delay)

Continuing our season series for the December 2015 launch of Perl 6.0.0 ...

(*Narrator: The language now known as Raku.*)

this is an introduction to Perl6 by comparison to Perl5 and Tolkien, Larry's 2015 conference talk.

It was the pre-announcement of the "yes *this* Christmas" release.

## October 13, 2015 "Perl 6 - A Dynamic Language for Mere Mortals" (Perl 6 is almost here: Part 1) - Ovid
 
This month Boston.pm presents a recorded talk by **Ovid (Curtis Poe)**
with live code examples prepared and demonstrated by Bill Ricker. 
Ovid describes his talk as, "[Perl 6](http://perl6.org/) is a great language,
but sometimes the enthusiasts talk about the crazy, scary things you
can do with it. In this talk, I discuss how easy it is to really use."
 
We'll have working examples in live Perl6 ([Rakudo Perl 6](http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/)), both copied from the main presentation to play with immediately on our screen, for kibitzing and tinkering, plus some other examples to try.
 
Program notes:

* We're planning to have several [Perl 6](http://perl6.org/) talks this Fall/Winter, building up to the Perl 6 formal release at Christmas, including:
    - P6 Regex & Grammars
    - P6 Concurrency and Asynchrony
    - If you have any Perl 6 code to share, maybe as a mini talk before main talk, or as an intermission, if it fits with a scheduled p6 talk!
* Anyone with things to talk about at future meetings, contact Bill and/or Tom.

 
About the Speaker

## June 9th, 2015 Federico Lucifredi resumes his hardware and Perl series

![Federico](./images/federico_lucifredi-oreilly.jpg)

A few years ago it was
[discovered](http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3554) that common SD
memory cards contain a micro controller that can be reprogrammed. In
this talk Federico hacks "some hardware to see if we can get to the CPU
on an SD card. Any automation in Perl, of course :)"


[**Federico Lucifredi**](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/5017) was the
maintainer of the `man` suite, the primary documentation-delivery tool
under Linux, a graduate of Boston College and Harvard University, and
the Ubuntu Server Product Manager at Canonical. He is a frequent speaker
locally for Boston.pm and [Boston Linux/UNIX](http://www.blu.org/),
often on "hardware hacking" topics.
 

## Tuesday, May 12, 2015 -  Social Gathering - 

 
Scheduling didn't come together for a speaker this month, so we are
opting for a social gathering at
[REDBONES](http://www.redbones.com/), in Davis Square, Somerville. Known
for their barbecue .
Join us for some food and to chat about Perl and whatever else.

*Narrator: Redbones was too full of Tufts Seniors celebrating last finals, so we went to **blue shirt** across the square.*

## March 10, 2015 - Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ - Mike Stemle, Jr.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq4B6m3a0H8)(youtube) 
[[file/view/Net__AMQP__RabbitMQ Presentation/543820114/Net__AMQP__RabbitMQ Presentation|Slides]] (pdf)
 
**Mike Stemle, Jr.** discusses his experiences at ThinkGeek working on and using [Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ), an interface library to [RabbitMQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ) , an open source message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

Being a Perl Shop is hard sometimes, and as a result you sometimes
miss out on some of the super-awesome third party support that other -
some would say, weaker (but of course we wouldn’t say that, we’re
classy) - languages enjoy. So I had to get my hands dirty. As such,
I contributed to the development of the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module so
that we at ThinkGeek could properly integrate our Perl applications
with this MQ server.

[![RabbitMQ example routing](./images/RabbitMQ-example-routing.png)](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)

I will walk you through a very high level of the integration itself,
some of the challenges we faced, and how we overcame them. I’ll also
go through some of the improvements I’ve made as part of the team of
people maintaining the Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ module. **BEWARE**, however,
this talk is not for the squeamish. There will be guts. perlguts, and
they’ll be everywhere.

# 2014


## December 9, 2014  - "Stirring the Hive with a Perl Stick : Hadoop and Perl" - Charles Hardin

LOCATION: [EIG](http://enduranceinternational.com/our-careers/our-locations/burlington), [10 Corporate Dr #300, Burlington, MA 01803](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Endurance+Int
ernational+Group/@42.495802,-71.193531,17z)
 
![Hadoop Hive Logo](./images/HadoopHive.png)

Hive provides a SQL-like interface to Hadoop. 
Perl can interoperate with Hive in a variety of ways, including Hive
queries through a Thrift API and the direct incorporation
of Perl into map-reduce jobs. 
The author has taken a few baby steps on this journey and chooses to
share the results with his peers.

KEYWORDS: Perl, Hadoop, Hive, Big Data, Thrift, Map-Reduce.
 
This meeting is being hosted by EIG, Sean and Charles's employer.
(A carpool from MIT and/or Red Line will be available for Car-Free commuters, talk to Bill.)

## October  - ShellShock CGI and Perl DoS bugs - Bill Ricker

![Shellshock bug logo](./images/shellshock-red.png)

 
We will examine the implications for the ShellShock BASH bug for Perl --
it's much wider than just about BASH CGI or even Perl CGI scripts --
and also a recently discovered/fixed but comparably long-lurking Perl
DoS bug in a core module (Data::Dumper stack smash CVE-2014-4330) and
how is it possibly remotely triggerable.
 
The good news is ShellShocker was slightly over-hyped; unlike
Heartbleed, this one does NOT generally affect the Internet of
Things. Your Internet-enabled toaster is likely immune. But Windows
and Mac are not entirely immune to this Linux bug.



## September - Creating And Managing a Private CPAN with Pinto & Stratopan [Jeffrey Thalhammer](http://search.cpan.org/~thaljef/)

If you use Perl, then you have probably wrestled with CPAN. Shifting
dependencies, incompatible interfaces, and test failures in CPAN modules
can suddenly break your application, leaving your team to chase bugs they
didn't create. But managing CPAN modules doesn't have to be painful. A
private CPAN repository gives you a stable platform for making consistent
builds and managing upgrades for all your Perl modules.

In this session, you'll learn how to use
**[Pinto](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pinto)** to create a private CPAN and
build your applications with the right modules, every time. You'll learn
about the dangers of the public CPAN and how a private CPAN can help
mitigate those risks. Finally, we'll cover some of the newest features
of Pinto and show you a few power-user tricks to get your private CPAN
up and running quickly.

[Stratopan](https://stratopan.com/about) is a startup founded by the speaker that provides "Private CPAN repositories securely hosted in the cloud." So Pinto is the tool that facilitates creating a private repository, and Stratopan lets you outsource the hosting of that repository.

**[Jeffrey Ryan Thalhammer](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=Jeffrey%20Ryan%20Thalhammer&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)** is a respected software developer, prolific open source contributor, and tech community leader. Author of **Perl::Critic** and **Pinto**, used by thousands of developers. Co-founder of Stratopan and Co-organizer of the San Francisco Perl Mongers. He consults under the brand [Imaginative Software Systems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/467266).

## July - Offensive & Defensive Web User Identity -  Zak Zebrowski

(Zak appeared remotely via Hangouts)

 
This talk looks at web users from a two different perspectives: First,
we look at identifying techniques to determine web user identities from
a server perspective. Second, we will look at obfuscating techniques from
a user whom seeks to be anonymous. Perl techniques will be highlighted.

## May - Ricardo Signes' 1.21 Gigawatts


**Ricardo Signes** (pre-recorded in NY, with _live_ Q&A via Hangouts)

A collection of the speaker's lightening talks, in the spirit of a highlight reel. 
We replayed a recording of [Ricardo's talk to NY.pm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG4fQUrkyK8), 
after which Ricardo joined us by tele-presense for **live Q&A** .)
 
Some talks carefully guide the listeners through the entirety of a topic,
starting with the basics and ending with the fine details. That's… not
the plan for this talk. Instead, we're going to see the highlight reel of
a bunch of topics that caught my interest over the course of the year:
a review of cool (and uncool) changes in Perl, the best modules you're
not using, stupid optimization tricks, tools for handling catastrophic
program failure, git scripts you'll become dependent on, numbers stations,
Zork, productivity tools, and who knows what else.
 
I will stand in place and let lightning talks strike over and over, until I am reduced to cinders.
 
You get to witness the ordeal, and you might just learn a thing or two.
 
We had a partially successful experiment with a "Hangout On Air" to broadcast the **Q&A portion** of this presentation: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG4fQUrkyK8)
 
And the bio:
 
**Ricardo Signes** is the current project manager for Perl 5, a maintainer of
the CPAN toolchain, part of the Moose development team, and a frequent
contributor of other free code to the CPAN. He likes to talk about
code almost as much as he likes to write it. He lives in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, and works at Pobox.com, where he spends his days trying
to cope with the horrors of email.

## February - Parsing weird LRECL data - Uri G "The PerlHunter"

*Parsing the weirdest fixed-record-length format you've ever seen!*


"at my new job i have created a parser for a very clunky fixed record
size format. it took longer than anticipated for various reasons. i have
a parser module, some db tables to help in real world stuff, a bunch of
one off scripts that did useful stuff. could be interesting to see how
such a project is done.

well, it was interesting to me as i was paid for it! a chance to code
review my stuff and show some nice slicing (perl slicing) and dicing
of data."

## January, 2014 - Deduplication and some modules 

### Ricky Morse - a short look at Data::Section and XML::XSLT

[example](http://pukku.com/bostonpm/2014-01-xslt/bostonpm.html)

### A recap panel re the **DFW Perl Mongers Deduplication Hackathon**


SPEAKERS: **Joel Berger, Tommy Butler, Yanick Champoux, Bruce Gray, Tim King**

MODERATOR: **Tom Metro**

 
How fast can Perl find duplicate files on a 100 GB file system? That's the
question the **Dallas/Fort Worth Perl Monger's Winter 2013 Deduplication
Hackathon** set out to answer. There were a diverse range of contest
entries, from the expected procedural Perl 5 code to ones that used Moose,
MOP, and even one Perl 6 entry.
 
Tom Metro will moderate a collection of prerecorded and live
lightning talks by the contestants. After a brief intro, we'll hear
from Bruce on his 6-line Perl 6 entry, from Tim (live in person)
with his comprehensive MOP based solution, from Joel with a classic
Perl 5 procedural solution, from Yanick with the officially winning
solution built with Moose (yes, the fastest used Moose!), and lastly
from the DFW.pm leader and contest organizer Tommy (live via Google
Hangout) with his unofficial Moose based solution, that post-contest,
was further tuned to beat everyone. Lastly, we'd like to hear from
the audience what you'd like to see as the topic of a future hackathon.

If you couldn't make it to the meeting, you can find most of the materials online.

The original [DFW.pm meeting recording](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvqqRFGMZS0).

You'll find Bruce Gray's Perl 6 entry discussed at time range 17:29 -
35:30. Joel Berger, who won for lowest memory, fewest lines of code,
and best **Perl::Critic** score, introduces himself at 10:54 - 12:48, and
then discusses his code at 1:06:10 - 1:21:01.

Tim, who won for **best documentation, most features, and best effort,**
discusses his code after Bruce, but I don't have the time index.

In a [separate video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MNuNupAvvg),
Yanick Champoux, the winner for fastest run time, discusses his code.

Tommy Butler, the contest organizer, discussed his unofficial entry
towards the end of the first video above. (At the Boston.pm meeting he
elaborated on some of the optimizations he added post-contest, leading
to a design that beats Yanick by 40 seconds.)

## November 12 - A new object system for the Perl 5 core. -  Stevan Little


In 2011 I started working on a project to improve the object system in Perl 5.
I wanted to take elements from Moose, as well as bring in some more
elements of the Perl 6 object system.
The first version of this work ended up suffocating under its own
complexity, but after this year's YAPC::NA I decided to come back to the
project with a fresh perspective and so far work is progressing very well.

In this talk I will walk through several examples of the proposed syntax
and feature set as well as discuss some of the underlying implementation
details. This will be an interactive talk and audience members are
encouraged to ask questions, poke holes in the design and help improve
the proposal.

## September 10 - Patching and Updating a CPAN Module - Bill R

**Bill Ricker** and **Tom Metro** (*remotely*)

Boston.pm adopted one of Damian's PBP modules, Config::Std. It was broken by Perl 5.18's security patch to randomize hash ordering. Debian Unstable reported the [https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85956 bug] (glad to know they're doing Perl 5.18 and packaging Config::Std!) and provided a patch. Ricky made sure the patch didn't invalidate Damian's design.<br /> <br /> 

## August Social At Cambridge Brewing Co

## July 9 Inline::Java (Perl and Java, together at last ?)


**William Cox** and **David Larochelle** on Using **`Inline::Java`** with Perl

This talk is a report on inquiry begun on the [mailing list](http://www.mail-archive.com/boston-pm@mail.pm.org/index.html#07176)
[slides @G](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nWaw6ER0yuh0dtHWDVETaGLe1GFCQ71kynyeN_-VEmM)

[Blog](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dlarochelle/2013/07/14/inlinejava-using-java-with-perl/)
 
Q “There is a question that the slides don't address which I am curious about -- why didn't you just use Java & Java-based languages? 

A. “each had major existing workflow in perl.one needed to fetch data only available with java api, other needed algorithm only with java api.”

A. “Exactly. Our ORM is in Perl. :Also, I did in 1 file of Perl what
Java would require in 10s. The need to maintain simplicity was important
for my group. You have to follow the business requirements laid before
you. A lot of my group writes Perl. The rest of engineering writing
the customer facing stuff writes in Java. We mainly communicate over a
database (read: not realtime). But there is the occasional bleed over
from Java land that we have to implement the exact same code on our end
as which ships in the product. But our framework is (largely) Perl. So
we glue the 2 together. And as engineers, "good enough" is perfect.

Some data points for "good enough:"

1. I can scan a Maven repo for updates in under an hour

2. I can apply a in-house algorithm to a directory structure in sub-second time”

## December 11, 2012 - Scott Mattocks - “treat your code like a member of the dev team.”

“You expect your developers to communicate well; you should expect
your code to communicate well. You expect your developers to continue
working when things go slightly wrong; you should expect your code to
continue working when things go slightly wrong.  The core message is
language neutral. The real-world lessons that contributed to the
creation of this presentation come from GSN where we use both Perl and
PHP on a daily basis. The presentation itself (see below) has some PHP
code snippets in it, but swapping those out for Perl is easy and won't
change the subject matter. Feel free to flip through (using left and
right arrow keys). If you think this is something the group can
benefit from, let me know and I will start rewriting the code blocks.”

## May 8, 2012 - Ricky Morse - Getting Started with Plack/PSGI

This talk will be a short overview of developing simple Plack/PSGI websites and making them run in CGI or proxy environments.




## April 10 - Revisiting the Dread CGI -- The Uri 

CGI refactored before and after 

As many of you have known and seen, Uri Guttman will do code review on the fly with anyone's code on display at pm meetings. This may seem frivolous or whatever but it is can be useful in many cases. He has a client for his Perl support/training services which entails lots of code and design review and it has proven very valuable to this shop. He has obtained permission to show one CGI script in its before any review state and after much review and refactoring. The author of the script did almost all of the editing and rewriting but for one sub rewrite that Uri did because it was more complex than the author could handle. The script went through 14 revisions and it still isn't where it should be (that means using a proper template module like Template::Simple) but it is light years from where it was. This talk is being called before/after. You will see some of the worst coding and template practices ever unleashed at a Boston.pm gathering. You will be in shock at the use of globals, the lack of subs, and the redundant everything everywhere. Then the tranquility of the after version will calm your senses, sooth your jangled nerves and show you there really can be order in this chaotic universe. Be prepared for coding hell and heaven! Fun is guaranteed for all!





## Tuesday March 3/13 (day *before* Pi Day )

*Scripting Ubuntu in Landscape* -- **Federico Lucifredi**

Canonical's systems management and monitoring tool, **Landscape** (Landscape.canonical.com) has multiple facilities for scripting to the system administrator' content -- facilities that can be used with any of the usual array of scripting language choices.  We will take a quick look at scripting the managed clients, then we delve into programming the Landscape API to script automation tasks from the shell, in effect, scripting the server, and how this allows custom integration of multiple tools.

Boston.PM's turn is September 14th, MIT  E51-376 7:30pm (refreshments in hallway at 7). {This is the night before BLU's PGP night, second Tuesday is as late as it gets this month.}  We'll install it and show what it can do. We may discuss what more the final release candidate will do, and if  enough non-regulars turn up, we can discuss what's in 5.12 that's not in the 5.8.4 or older that's still on many commercial Unix systems 


> Announce: Rakudo Star - a useful, usable, "early adopter" distribution of Perl 6  
> Submitted by pmichaud on Thu, 07/29/2010 - 05:18

> On behalf of the Rakudo and Perl 6 development teams, I'm happy to announce the July 2010 release of "Rakudo Star", a useful and usable distribution of Perl 6. 

> Rakudo Star is aimed at "early adopters" of Perl 6. We know that it still has some bugs, it is far slower than it ought to be, and there are some advanced pieces of the Perl 6 language specification that aren't implemented yet. But Rakudo Perl 6 in its current form is also proving to be viable (and fun) for developing applications and exploring a great new language. These "Star" releases are intended to make Perl 6 more widely available to programmers, grow the Perl 6 codebase, and gain additional end-user feedback about the Perl 6 language and Rakudo's implementation of it.

> In the Perl 6 world, we make a distinction between the language ("Perl 6") and specific implementations of the language such as "Rakudo Perl". "Rakudo Star" is a distribution that includes release #31 of the Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, version 2.6.0 of the Parrot Virtual Machine, and various modules, documentation, and other resources collected from the Perl 6 community. We plan to make Rakudo Star releases on a monthly schedule, with occasional special releases in response to important bugfixes or changes.

> Some of the many cool Perl 6 features that are available in this release of Rakudo Star:

    * Perl 6 grammars and regexes
    * formal parameter lists and signatures
    * metaoperators
    * gradual typing
    * a powerful object model, including roles and classes
    * lazy list evaluation
    * multiple dispatch
    * smart matching
    * junctions and autothreading
    * operator overloading (limited forms for now)
    * introspection
    * currying
    * a rich library of builtin operators, functions, and types
    * an interactive read-evaluation-print loop
    * Unicode at the codepoint level
    * resumable exceptions

> There are some key features of Perl 6 that Rakudo Star does not yet handle appropriately, although they will appear in upcoming releases. Thus, we do not consider Rakudo Star to be a "Perl 6.0.0" or "1.0" release. ...

action.

I would cover the following:

* Core concepts (~15 min)
* Getting started (~25 min)
* Working alone with git (~20 min)
* Working with others with git, the traditional way (~20 min)

## September 9 - Easy cryptanalysis with `tr`, `s`, and `/usr/dict/word` - Bill Ricker

Using Perl to solve a simple substitution cipher cryptogram.


First, collect simple [word-counts](./scripts/words-count.pl.html) - small repeated and long non-repeated words.
```
word        	Count	length
G           	  5	  1
B           	  4	  1
U           	  2	  1
HJZ         	 11	  3
XGHJ        	  7	  4
HJZIZ       	  4	  5
FIGFWDLHU   	  2	  9
HJGH        	  4	  4
UJLKBPY     	  2	  7
UFBZPHLRLYBUHU	  1	 14
AZRBWLAUWBGPU	  1	 13
FIZGHBLPBUHU	  1	 12
HL          	  6	  2
GRKGTU      	  2	  6
```

Can we guess which of the 3 one-letter words is possessive 'S and not a 'real' word?
```
perl words-count.pl --dump | ack '(?:(?=\S)\W)?\b\w\b'  --passthru
```
That makes it pretty obvious which one is only as possessive, preceded by an apostrophe.
(There's a reason professionals didn't include punctuaion unless it was carefully enciphered also!)

Next, check if any long words are obvious from their pattern (pattern's own pattern is ABCCDEF or 1233456).
[pattern words](./scripts/patternword.pl.html)


Finally [iterate guessing letter translations](./scripts/chu.pl.html), with hints for words that dictionary says are uniquely determined already.


[Tarball](./scripts/simple-decipher-chu.tar.xz) includes a "how" file with sequence for self demo.

## May 8, Tuesday, Tech Meeting


**Greg London** gave a talk based on his book, [Bounty Hunters (Metaphors for Fair Intellectual Property Laws)](http://www.Greg London.com/bountyhunters/). 

> The metaphors we use to describe the abstract concept of intellectual
works bring along their own set of baggage. The metaphor of "property"
automatically invokes the idea of "owner" and "theft" and "pirate". But
some metaphors describe reality better than others. This book introduces
the metaphor of authors and inventors as Bounty Hunters. The public
offers a bounty to any individual willing to create some as-yet-
undiscovered work. Creators provide a "service" in the same vein as a
Bounty Hunter provides a service of catching bad guys.

## April 10, Tuesday, Tech Meeting

allows developers to quickly develop complex, security aware web-based
applications. The talk will include no mention of Ajax or Web 2.0 type
stuff, instead focusing on the technologies driving the server-side and
the methodologies and design decisions behind them."

**Jason McIntosh** gave a presentation on *Volity*: "Volity is an open

## October 10, Tuesday, Tech Meeting


**Kenneth Graves** walked us through his three versions of a Kokuro solver.
starting with a simple but inefficient brute force approach and ending with
one with optimizations and heuristics to make it nice and speedy.

**Bill Ricker** showed us his script for solving doublets, aka word ladders.

Making Word ladders or doublets is finding a sequence single letter edits that will transform one word to another where all the intermediate states are also words. E.g.,  `cat=>cot=>dot=>dog` and `grass=>grabs=>crabs=>cribs=>cries=>cried=>creed=>greed =>green`

```
perl -I. ./search2.pl one two

*Found* one=>owe=>ewe=>eye=>rye=>roe=>toe=>too =>two
*Found* one=>owe=>awe=>aye=>rye=>roe=>toe=>too =>two
*Found* one=>ore=>ere=>eye=>rye=>roe=>toe=>too =>two

## September 25, Monday, Special Tech Meeting


**Damian Conway** gave his opentalk 2.0 and [The DaVinci Codebase talks](https://www.flickr.com/photos/zippy/albums/72157594214387562), (both reprises of his OSCON 2006 and OSCON Europe 2005 keynotes).

**opentalk 2.0**

> In the green pastures of technology trends, Damian Conway leaves no
sacred cow un-tipped. This entertaining keynote address, from the 2005
O'Reilly European Open Source Convention, pokes fun at many hot topics
for software developers including: software patents, open source, mash
ups, online communities, rapid application development, operating system
zealotry, and even Joss Whedon's movies and TV shows.

**The DaVinci Codebase**

> When a dying operating system scrawls his name across its corrupted boot
volume, Dr. Damian Conway, an unassuming college professor, is plunged into
a deadly race against time to solve a series of impossible riddles. What is
the mysterious "Priory of Bios?" And who are their deadly nemeses "Opus
Arai?" On the run from the law and stalked by a ghostly pale killer, will
he unravel the subtle clues hidden in Leonardo's most famous source code
and reveal to the world the incredible secret encrypted in...the Da Vinci
Codebase?


Uri Guttman organized a foil hat contest, so the audience could protect themselves from Damian's mind-warping influence.

<Damian2006Mementos.html> has more details about this exciting meeting, including a fun video of the judging of the foil hat contest and pictures of the winners.

**David Golden** present **Eversion 101: An Introduction to Inside-Out Objects.**

  Inside-out objects offer intriguing advantages over traditional Perl
  objects, but at the cost of substantial complexity. This talk reviews
  pros and cons of inside-out objects and teaches the basics of how they
  work. It includes three core concepts, four ways to make them and five
