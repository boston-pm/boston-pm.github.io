<p>Damian Conway, known for his rapid-paced, wide-ranging, tour-de-force
presentations, was the keynote presenter at The Perl Conference, 2017
(formerly known as YAPC::NA). In his keynote he tells “a tale of
madness, obsession, and coding extremity,” describing what it took to
bring 3 keywords from Perl 6 to Perl 5. A community effort that took
three years and 2.8 million lines of code. This is a more extreme
example of what some developers are going through to bring Perl 6
functionality to Perl 5.</p>
<p>We will watch his recorded keynote and discuss among ourselves.</p>

<p>Tonight (<em>As an emergency substitute talk</em>) we will be having
a mini-hackathon on the <code>Config::Std</code> CPAN module that
Boston.pm maintains. We’ll be offering a live demonstration of setting
up continuous integration (CI) using Travis CI and Appveyor, two hosted
CI tools made freely available for open source projects on GitHub. Join
us as we stumble through the process and learn from our mistakes.</p>
<p>Perl has had <code>Test::Harness</code> for decades, with CPANTS
providing distributed Continuous Integration testing of Released CPAN
module distributions for a decade or more. Thank you CPANTS volunteers
for creating a distributed cloud for us :-). Now GitHub is offering
similar capabilities to all the other FLOSS communities via free
integration with freemium cloud Continuous Integration tools Travis-CI
(for Linux) and Appveyor (for Windows). Since we have CPANTS for
release, we can use Travis-ci&amp;Appveyor to test our DEV branch after
check-in. They’ll even test Pull Requests before merge! Any GitHub FLOSS
project can use these, but Perl CPAN projects can make use easily since
we already have a regression testing culture, we won’t need to write the
tests, just enable them.</p>
<h2 id="nov.-14th---adam-russell-live---deep-learning-in-perl">Nov. 14th
- Adam Russell (live!) - “Deep Learning in Perl”</h2>
<p><strong>LIVE Speaker !</strong></p>
<p><em>Remember, if you get Veterans’ Day Monday off work, Tuesday will
feel like Monday.</em></p>
<p><strong>“Deep Learning with AI::MXNet: Navigating implementation
issues”</strong></p>
<p>ABSTRACT This talk will cover lessons learned from a recent
experience in getting a deep learning projected started, with little
prior experience in AI. All code will use the Perl MXNet API and guide
the audience through developing a simple model, which is then built on
to perform more complex tasks.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for a long time captured the popular
imagination. Results from academia and industry have finally started to
deliver on some of the long hoped for results: self driving cars,
automated medical diagnoses, and written and verbal language processing.
These areas are showing advances that were once simply products of
fiction writers. The current wave of AI enthusiasm may be attributed to
what is called Deep Learning which is a convenient label for relatively
new techniques using neural networks. The possibility for increased
automation across virtually every industry has resulted in the spinning
up of many new startup companies, as well as new projects within
existing enterprises, resulting in the need to develop the skills
necessary to pursue this new area.</p>
<p>While not the language of production, Perl is used to develop
algorithms and demonstrate concepts before they receive fuller
treatment. Deep Learning practitioners often begin their deep learning
work, correctly, with a review of the literature and research into the
fundamentals. Projects then often start confidently with high hopes,
built on that conceptual understanding, only to quickly get bogged down
in unforeseen, but critically important, issues of implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Russell</strong> is a software engineer with OptumLabs’
Center for Applied Data Science (CADS). CADS is tasked with developing
prototype applications which implement recent advances in algorithms and
technology to address issues of importance to Optum business interests.
Most recent projects have been focused on Deep Learning. Adam has a PhD
in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, his
academic interests involve Computational Geometry and Data Visualization
and these explorations, much like the work described in this talk, are
all Perl driven. He also teaches, on an adjunct basis, at Wentworth
Institute of Technology in Boston.</p>

Space-exploration on-line role-playing-game called “Tau Station” in
Perl. It’s even a business. In this talk, he describes the games
industry and how Modern Perl makes building his game fun.</p>
<p>Original Abstract -</p>
<p>“With Tau Station, we’re building a sci-fi universe in a browser.
However, in object oriented design, what does the”single responsibility
principle” mean when your combat armor serves as armor, a weapon, and
medkit?</p>
<p>“And when many different behaviors have long chains of duplicated
requirements (for example, do you have enough money to buy a medkit, or
refuel your ship, or repair your blaster, or bribe a guard), how do you
handle that in an efficient an easy to read manner?</p>
<p>“And how do you avoid god objects when your character in the universe
drives almost everything?</p>
<p>“This talk explores some of the techniques we’ve developed for Tau
Station to easily model complex behaviors.”</p>
<p>We’ll have our usual community discussion after (or by hitting pause
as needed) in lieu of speaker Q&amp;A.</p>

<p><strong>GPS! Randomness with Radiation!</strong></p>
<p>Abstract: Using the lowest amount of custom hardware and pouring Perl
over everything as the glue binding it all, we create two minimalistic
devices delivering a perfectly tuned network time source (synchronizing
with a GPS satellite), and a naturally random entropy source (leveraging
a Geiger tube’s measurement of natural background radiation).</p>

<p>or, <strong><em>Ringing halfsheets with Perl 6</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Meetings resume ! September at the usual place</em></p>
<p>After ringing a bell for 45 minutes to 3 hours, you kind of want
people to know you did it, and what you did it for. Ricky uses Perl 6 to
replace a manual process for creating “half-sheets” to post in the Old
North ringing room, for tourists to see.</p>
<p>Ricky sensibly doesn’t want to retype or copy-paste what’s already
somewhere on-line, so he uses Perl 6 to pull the data from a database as
XML, and then typeset the half sheets. This is using <strong>Perl6, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groff_%28software%29">GROFF</a>,</strong>
and <strong>C6PAN Modules</strong> <code>Template::Mustache</code>,
<code>XML::XPath</code>, and <code>HTTP::User Agent</code>.</p>

<p><strong>A guided tour of QualityBox, a MediaWiki hosting
service</strong></p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Greg Rundlett, founder of eQuality Technology, has created a hosted
software service called QualityBox which is provides the wiki engine
(MediaWiki) that drives Wikipedia. Like Wikipedia, QualityBox is
instantly usable by the end-user. And like Wikipedia, it includes a huge
number of configurations, extensions and customizations that make it
supremely useful. Greg will take us on a tour of QualityBox, and the
MediaWiki ecosystem to illustrate some of the features and capabilities
that are available right “out of the box”.</p>
<p>Featuring: - MediaWiki 1.31 LTS - Visual Editor - ElasticSearch
(v5.6.10) - Excellent Mobile support - Modern and traditional layouts -
New dashboards - Top to Bottom security upgrades - Free SSL certificates
- Subdomain-based wiki farms - And LOTS more.</p>
<p>(<em>Narrator: The BLU and Boston.PM wikis were hosted as the demos
on QualityBox. Alas the business model fizzled by the end of 2021. It
was nice while it lasted. The experimental multi-tenancy MediaWiki was a
cool idea.</em>)</p>

Bill Ricker</h2>
<p><strong>Hue-Saturation-Luminance for Ack3 with Convert::Color::HSL
and Term::ANSIColor</strong></p>
<p>Curious about how to handle different color spaces in Perl?</p>
<p><strong>Bill Ricker</strong> will show how he improved RBG palette
help for <a href="https://beyondgrep.com"><strong>Ack3</strong></a>
using the HSL colorspace model and CPAN module that does HSL&lt;-&gt;RGB
transform.</p>
<p>Ack uses an module <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ANSIColor"><strong><code>Term::ANSIColor</code></strong></a>
that uses base-6 colors from 000 to 555 .
<code>ack --help-rgb-colors</code> will display all possible colors. The
palette display was formerly laid-out as convenient for the code loop,
not for the viewer’s comprehension.</p>
<p>Reorganizing it according to a geometric color model makes it easier
to see the various gradients between color coordinates. <strong>Bill
Ricker</strong> used <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Convert::Color::HSL"><strong><code>Convert::Color::HSL</code></strong></a>
to prototype a new palette-help, as seen in new <a

11, E51-376 (Back to 3rd Floor) ¨Perl begat Perl¨ - Uri Guttman</h2>
<p>They say only Perl can parse Perl, but Perl can also generate Perl.
In “<strong><em>Perl begat Perl</em></strong>”, a preview of a talk Uri
will present at this year’s Perl Conference, he will discuss how you can
generate Perl inside Perl and then call eval on the code. Uri will
explain why you might want to to use this technique, and illustrate it
with good and bad examples.</p>
<p><strong>Uri Guttman</strong> is a founding member of Boston Perl
Mongers, a long time presence in the Perl community, and founder/owner
of Stem Systems, a Perl consultancy, and known as “The Perl Hunter,” a
recruiter specializing in placing Perl talent.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMW1hCpP2Is">TPC Video of
same talk</a> has abstract -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever wondered why some CPAN modules actually generate Perl
code to be eval’ed? Some of the reasons are simplicity but most often it
is for getting faster running code. The key Perl feature used is eval on
strings (the dangerous eval, not the safe eval of blocks). Newbies are
always warned not to use string eval but this talk will show you why and
how to use it for your benefit. Simple and common examples will be shown
that anyone can use. Then more complex examples from existing CPAN
modules (two of which are by the speaker) will be covered. They use Perl
code generation for major speed gains (including 4x in one case).</p>
